300436199	In nowadays, people pay more and more attention on health, as the life condition rises. Parents become nutrist almost, they could share articles about health in their social median frequently post op one important topic is about smoking that is harmful to the smokers and othe people around them. But some argue that smoking can be accepted. However, in my view, the source of smoking is cigarette, which should be restricted by paying large amounts of money as a smoking tax.The 1st and most important reason why should levy taxes is that it can reduce the number of cigarettes consumed by smokers. If the manufactures of cigarettes are required to pay more money, they would rise the price of cigarettes. Result, smokers only can buy list cigarettes with the same budget on smoking. Consequently, smokers consumed less cigarettes will face a smaller potential risk of developing cancer, especially the lung cancer.Another reason why government shout livy a higher tax on cigarettes manufactures is that gaining more money to invest on health care industry. There is a common knowledge that smoking is one of the key causes leading to lung cancer. Therefore, people and government spend a huge amount of money to treat lung cancer, but there are still millions of patients died every year. As a result, government need more money to support the promotion of the awareness the disadvantage of smoking, to build a more advanced health care system, especial for these undeveloped countries, such as in China that contributes approximately one third of the lung cancer population, While the overall chiness population is only 20% of the whole world's population.In contrast, some argue that there are many disadvantage of a higher tax on cigarette manufactures, like increasing the economic pressure to the smokers whose desire of smoking is very strong, reduction of the original cigarette price causing to the lower income for cigarettes farmers.In conclusion. It is necessary to pay more money.	4	5	4	4	4	4
300443203	The smoking causes are cancer which is so serious disease. The smoking cigarette has gained significant popularity in recent years. According to the same scientists, it is enormous impact on health problems, there is no doubt that. The smoking may reduce stress. However, it affects health issue and impacts on smoker’s budget. For those reasons, it is my opinion that companies should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people.One of the most significant reason is that the smoking cigarette creates health problems. People who has to be healthy for achieving their own goal. It is required to be great level of motivation. If smokers consume more cigarette, they can lose their learning capability to improve themselves.Another important reason is that smoking cigarette affects smokers income negatively. The cigarette is very expensive. Smokers can purchase beneficial materials which are books, home furniture or clothes instead of cigarette. Smokers have to identify this issue and avoid from cigarette. Some companies which manufacture cigarettes are not reliable. Their advertising and marketing strategies provides lack of information to impacts on smokers opinion efficiently. After that, smokers tend to consume more cigarette.conclusion, cigarette has many unbenefits. government should regulate this process. Manufacture companies should obey implement policy.	3	4	4	4	4	4
300400010	Nowadays, the number of people who develop cancer smoking increase significantly. Smoking is very dangerous and harmful for people and children. I believed that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay a lot of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. In my opinion, that is a good idea and the following argument will explain this view.first of all, smoking is a bad habit of almost men and some woman has the same situation. The consequence of smoking is the increase of people who are cancer. There are some companies which manufacture cigarettes pay large amounts of money to people who develop cancer from smoking will have more opportunities to prevent the cancer. For example, in Vietnam, a lot of men are cancer from smoking and they do not have money to prevent the cancer. Therefore, there are some companies inside and outside Vietnam support the financial for them to help people who are cancer may be better. In addition, these companies want to demonstrate the impacts of smoking.Moreover, the action of these companies will help people who develop cancer from smoking have more motivations to live continually, because they have supporting such as money from the companies which manufacture cigarettes. In other words, the cancer is frequently developing and it will become more dangerous day by day. Some people are cancer from smoking just wait for die because they do not have strong financial to prevent the developing of cancer. The supporting of these companies may help people who are cancer maintain their life.In conclusion, smoking is a bad habit and people should prevent doing it. The action of the companies is not only help people who are cancer from smoking have more opportunities come over the difficult situation, it also give them the motivation to maintain their life. Therefore, companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking.	3	5	4	4	4	4
300451442	Recently, there are some studies which smoking increases that percentage of people who develop cancer. Because of this fact there is an idea that companies which produce cigarettes should pay a lot of money as compensation don't stop this is a is agree that idea and it shows two reasons. One is that this system can reduce the number of cigarettes companies and second reason is this system also can reduce the number of smoker.First, this paying system is good for reducing companies which manufacture cigarettes. If companies have to pay large amount of money, it is big damage for companies and their profit will become small. This is why, their positive effects which is produced from making cigarettes will reduce and the number of companies also will decrease year by year. In addition, if the companies related to cigarettes decrease, this system of paying money leads to the other companies which produce something causes the bad influence for people's health. Reducing these company, is good effects for people.Secondly, this system can decline the number of people who use cigarettes. Its companies which manufacture cigarettes must pay large amounts of money as compensation, the price of cigarettes will be expensive because the companies have to get more profit. That change makes harder to buy for people. In addition, smoking increase the rate of cancer for people. This is why, if the number of smoker decrease, the number of people who will face cancer problem also decrease.On the other hand, there is an opinion that companies should not pay money because they don't force people to use cigarettes. So, people who use cigarettes should pay more money. Of course, smoker should pay money more. However, if the number of companies which advertise smoking decline, that influence the increase of non-smokers because people will get opportunity for smoking less than before.In conclusion, this is a argues about two advantages of the system which companies related to smoking should pay more money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. If the system stops, it can reduce the number of companies related to smoking and smokers. This is why, it is agree the paying system.	5	5	5	5	5	5
300462744	It is quite common these days for people in many parts of the world to smoke. Smoking is harmful for our health, environment and society. If these companies of manufacturing cigarettes could pay huge amounts of money, it would reduce the number of cigarettes and increase the price of cigarettes. Therefore, from my perspective, although someone might think this is a bad idea, I still believe that the method can play a key role to reduce the amounts of smoker, so reduce and help the people who has cancer from smoking.There are strong grounds for believing that through the method that increasing the amounts of money which cigarettes companies should pay for can be a good idea. In the 1st place, if these companies pay for large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking, it would lead to huge losses so that these companies do not have enough money to produce more and more cigarettes, which could reduce the number of cigarettes, because which might reduce the number of smokers. Therefore reducing the rate of developing cancer from smoking. I think this is a good cycle to reduce the negative effects of smoking for our health, environment and society.Another reason for the method is that if these companies pay huge amounts of money for people who develop cancer from smoking, it would make these companies to raise the price of cigarettes stop the reason I have mentioned above, these companies want to resolution their losses so they would through the approach which increasing the price of cigarettes, which leads to more and more people can not afford the cigarettes. And then they might reduce the number of they smoke everyday so that reducing the negative effects of smoking for our life. Therefore, these factors can justify why I think the method is a good idea.However, someone think this is a bad idea because it is unfair for companies which manufacture cigarettes. These companies manage is do not teach people to smoke, do not make people to develop cancer, they only are businessmen as same as other companies, such as shoes companies. It is sure that they do not lead to other people ill, however, if our society do not have any companies which manufacture cigarettes, nobody wood smoking, so nobody will develop cancer from smoking. They have the responsibility to pay money for people who hurted by smoking.In conclusion, it is no doubt that the measure that requiring companies which manufacture cigarettes pay huge numbers of money as compensation to people who has cancer from smoking is a good idea. Because the method could lead to these companies 'cause huge losses, so they would reduce the number of cigarettes and increase the price of cigarettes, therefore, reducing the negative effects to our lives. I believe that, in the future, more and more people will like to quit smoking. Let's work together to creat a better life for ourselves.	5	5	5	4	4	4
300465371	Nowadays, there are many people smorke in the world and smorking is occurred cancer. Cancer is serious disease for us and if we become cancer, we will need a lot of money to cure cancer. This essay will argue that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking, because cigarettes are bad for health. In addition, companies have a lot of money.First, cigarettes aren't good for health, so companies don't think people health. Company did people feeling which want to smorke. If the companies don't make a cigaret, people will not smorke, so companies should pay for people who develop cancer.Second, companies have a lot of money. There are many person who is poor or rich. If we are rich, we will be able to pay money to cure cancer, but if we are poor, we will be not able to pay to cure cancer, so companies which manufacture cigarettes, but the companies don't have enough money, so money which is cigarettes should increase the cost, then the companies should collect money from each person who buy cigarettes till stop at last, the companies paid to people who develop cancer from smorking.On the other hand, smorking is responsible by each person, because if we don't smorke, we will be cancer from smorking, so many people think people who become cancer from smorking have to pay money to cure cancer by themselves, but if the people don't have enough money, the people will not be able to cure the cancer, so it is not and people don't want to die from cancer, so the company should help two people who develop cancer from smorking.In conclusion, the companies have to pay monies people who develop cancer from smorking, because the companies make dangerous cigarettes. People need many money to live healthy, so the companies have to pay two people who develop cancer from smoking.	3	3	3	3	3	3
300467528	With the steady growth in the country's economy as well as the people's living standard an increasing number of people are likely to choice smoking as an interest to release pressure. Some people think that companies manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who suffer cancer from smoking. Although these method take attention to many people and give grant to those people. It caused more and more people negalate the dangers of cigarettes. Moreover, it caused the unfair of the society so stop it is my opinion that this is a bad idea.The main reason to support clain is that it cause a large amounts of people negalate the dangerous of smoking. Some people may think the money are important than health. With the development of the technology, that medicine developing fast. If put lots of money to those people who develop cancer they will think themself take advantage of this. They don't care about their health and by this way to get more money.The further reason to support claim is that the method caused the unfair of society. This is a bad behavior to smoking. Those people who choice bad behavior it develop cancer is them own choice. For many people they don't have money to pay for large medicine cost and even wait to die. For example, the two people stayed in the hospital, caused by cigarettes, the other is caused by car accident. The first patient is supported many money to take medicine so stop the other people growth in poor family, they don't have money to pay for the cost. It cause the unfair.Some people think it can show a good company, increasing the sense of belonging. It is true that company have responsible to do something to compensation people and maintain their service. Although it seems that reasonable and attractively, it cannot hold the water. The bad behaviour is the individuals choice. When companies put money into the society it cause many positive impacts and influence the social atmosphere. Let more people to have a bad idea to earn money.In conclusion, although it is benefit for companies to provide a good service, it cause people negalate their health and attractive more people to smoking. Moreover, it caused the unfair of the society. If use the suitable strategies by understand and manipulating relevant factors the problems could be fine and achieve the desired outcome.	5	5	4	5	4	5
300470595	There are still amount of people smoke even if they know it is bad for their health. So there is a question: should companies which manufacture cigarettes pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking? I don't agree with this idea.Smoking or not, it is people zone decisiones. Not everyone chooses smoking and not everyone have cancer from smoking. There is a situation that whether you have cancer is not based on the time you smoke. Some people they smoke for a long time, they even do not have cancer even when they are old. But some people may develop cancer when they smoke not for a long time. So I think it depends on people's physical condience. so companies do not need to pay amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking.If people know the companies will pay large amount of money for people who develop cancer from smoking, so the people will not decrease smoking. So it is not a good way to avoid people smoking. As we know, there are many harmful things in one cigarette. We even do not have a deep understanding about these harmful things. So it is useless that people already have sick about smoking then companies have the action about it like pay money to people. It is important that people should have the mind to reduce smoking instead of spending much money after have cancer from smoking.There also have some benefits about companies which manufacture cigarettes pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. Do to peoples stress become more heavier than before, more and more people choose to smoke to avoid much pressure which in their work and families. If they smoke for a time, they cannot stop. So some people will have the heavy illness like cancer. It is a useful way to help these people to get much better. The government still should tell people the harm of smoking and make people know much about the cigarettes.Although companies which manufacture cigarettes pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking may help people out of the harm of cancer, there still not a good way to avoid people smoking too much. Government should have action to focus on the number of cigarettes which companies sell at day and people also should control the number of cigarettes they smoking a day.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300475607	Cigarettes are something which have high risks of cancer. Some people argued that the cigarettes companies should compensate large amounts of money to people who develop cancer because of smoking. It this essay, I will argue that why it is not a good idea.Firstly, smoking is an individual behaviour. That means it is actually people can avoid to smoke, so that they will not develop cancer. But many men like to snug as frequent as eating. If they smoke 3 * 1 day or a pack of cigarettes one week, it is a fact that they must have illness from smoking when they are old. Why the cigarettes companies must pay for these people who can not control themselves? Moreover, smoking is a good way to reduce stress for men if they know the risks of cigarettes.Secondly, it is hard to say that the cancer is caused by smoking. As we all know, cancer is 1 diseases that can not be cured, and there are many reasons for the cancer. It is a big problem to define the cancer is caused by cigarettes. if a person has a hobby too smoke and he developed cancer, but he also has other serious illness, how to make sure that the cancer is caused by smoking not other illness? So it is difficult to range what the companies should to compensate.It is true that cigarettes companies should tell public that risks of smoking. People have the rights to know why cigarettes is dangerous and they will have option to choose smoking. Therefore, many companies copy the symbol of dangerous smoking on the plastic pack. Even though they can highlight the risks, they can not prevent people to smoking more. Thus, the cigarettes companies have no responsibility to compensate people. Next line in conclusion, to some extent, it is not a good idea let companies to pay for someone develop cancer from smoking. The risks of cigarettes should be taken by smokers, and the companies only have the responsibility to tell public the risks.	4	4	4	4	3	4
300476894	In the contemporary world, manufacturing the cigarettes are very profitable and I growing number companies start to manufacture cigarettes in order to earn more money. Under circumstance, people have a discussion whether companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay a lot of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking or not. Some people consider that companies which makes cigarettes should pay lots of money for people. But, other people hold the opinion that people who like to smoke never care about their health, so it is unnecessary to pay money for those people. In my opinion, companies which manufacture cigarettes should be responsible to pay large amounts of money for people suffering from cancer.There are some evidences to show that it is necessary to pay money for people from cancer although many people disagree my opinion. The first of all, many people suffer from cancer due to fact that they smoke too many cigarettes, these cigarettes are manufactured by these companies. If these companies stop or reduce the amounts of cigarettes produced, the rights of people suffering from cancer will decrease. What is more, the leaders from companies never care about people's health and produce a large amounts of cigarette for their own profit. Therefore, these leaders should pay money as compensation to those patients. Finally, those cigarettes advertisements have a bad example two teenagers. Many teenagers see some adults smoke in the public areas boy television and think they are cool, so they also start to knew the cigarettes by some cigarettes advertisement, And then try to smoke, so these cigarettes advertisements which created by companies has a negative effect on teenagers.It is not denied that some people who develop cancer from other vectors and many people who like to smoke still can live for a long time, but it is a reason why people can ignore the harm of cigarettes. Too many people suffer from cancer even die due to the cigarettes. Smoking not only be harmful for own health but also impart on others. They still manufacturers although companies know these. Therefore, they have responsibility of those people who develop cancer and should pay money as compensation to people.	4	4	5	4	4	4
300400011	nowadays, people live in modern life with enhanced facilities and high standard of demands. People usually use products which help them satisfy and cigarettes might be a necessary product which most of men smoke. They who believe that manufacture cigarettes should invest amount of money in compensation which prevent cancer from smoking. In my view, companies should practise this strategy to help consumers who develop cancer and people who beside them such as children.The most significant reason why companies should make actions is preventing cancer for consumers. Following that statistics, a large number of people who had cancer is remarkable increase. Everyday, people use too much with a huge of cigarettes which effect to their lung or breath and many kinds of body.If companies create competition, a number of consumers can limit. For example, many companies regulate a strategy which is informational marketing. That is showed a scaried pictures on the cover of cigarettes box which described a person use cigarettes with transformed body.Another reason is concerned about the health which is children. They are also a important factor which society should remind. Although, children do not consume cigarettes, they are also affected from this. Most importantly, children have health which is not strong like adult. So, the harmful smoking from using cigarettes would destroy children's body quickly.Some people think manufacture cigarettes make a compensation which lead to less profit. It is true that the number of customers would be decreased. However, companies are sustainable growth, because it is so difficult to stop smoking when smokers use cigarettes like a habit. In order to maintaining revenue, companies could boost the price of products, not only grow economy, but also decreasing cancer problems.In conclusion, it is significant to strategy when companies decide pay large amounts of money as compensation. Customers will be convinced from compensation and limit the number of cigarettes. Not only preventing cancer problems from adult, but also Children's Health.	5	5	5	5	4	5
300458321	Nowadays, more and more people choose smoking to get relax. Smoker has become a huge part of world population. Meanwhile, lots of people get cancer because of smoke. Some people think the cigarette companies should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking, but some people don't agree with it. This essay will argue that these companies should pay money for these people because they get huge profit from smoker and it is a kind of responsibility.The most significant reason is that the companies which manufacture cigarettes get large amounts of money from the people who smoking. They need to do something not just take money in their profit because smoker will reduce if more people dead because of cancer. meanwhile, these companies pay money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking can give smokers strong confidence and let them do not worried about cancer. Therefore, cigarette companies pay money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking is good for their social role.Secondly, it is a kind of responsibility if these companies pay money to these people because these people develop cancer through their products. Most people will think a lot when they smoking, and the smokers will be reduced if these companies do nothing about this issue. Therefore, companies such manufactured cigarettes should pay more attention on these people who develop cancer from smoking.In contrast, some people think these companies shouldn't pay money for these people because the government and hospital should in charge about these issue. It is true that we cannot check that these people will get cancer only because of smoking. However, these companies be a part of our society and they should be responsible.In conclusion, companies which produce cigarettes pay money to these people not only good for their social role, it is also have a notable benefits for their business in the future. In this way, these companies will be more stronger.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300465369	Nowadays, it is easy to buy cigarettes and there are many kinds of cigarettes such as electric cigarettes, sweety smell cigarettes. There is a often debate about companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking or not. This is able argue that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amount of money because cancer may lead to death and high compensation fee may cause decrease cigarettes manufacture companies.The first reason to support this argue is that, cancer may lead to death. In fact, cancer is the one of disease that difficult to cure. If cancer be founded later stage, cancer move to another place and it will be impossible to cure. Thus, cigarettes manufacture companies should pay large amount of money as compensation.The second reason to support this argument is expensive compensation fee make decrease of companies which manufacture cigarettes. If there is no company of manufactured cigarettes people will give up to buy cigarettes and no one struggle from cancer because of cigarettes. For good health to people paying large amount of money is good way.On other hand, some people argue that the cancer because of cigarettes is responsible for the people who bought cigarettes. However, if no one make cigarettes and no one sell cigarettes, everyone can live without of worry from cancer because of cigarettes.in conclusion, cigarettes cause cancer and it is possible to kill the people. Thus, need to decrease companies which manufacture cigarettes. Then, the most effective way to decrease companies is companies which manufacture cigarettes pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking.	3	4	4	3	3	3
300478717	In these days the development technology make our lifestyle more better, for example, computer technology, transportation system and farming. These things provide us amount of merits and improve quality of life. However, many child using mobile phone to contact with their relatives and friends because parents give them to protect from strangers. This essay will argue that children who aged 8 - 12 now should not use mobile phone, because mobile phone is harm child eyes and brain and induce lack of concentrate during study.To begin with, mobile phone can be harm their eyes and brain. A researcher says that mobile phones light which name is “Blue light” is harm human body, not only adults. This light damege to their eyes viewing especially children, actually children who aged under 18 years old body is undeveloped so easy to get bad effects. Furthermore, this light make their brain bad like promote lack of sleep. Thus, children who aged 8-12 should not use mobile phone.Secondly, mobile phone makes children lack of concentrate. In many parts of world, most children has a mobile phone to communicate with their family, but these children using the smartphone during school time. Mobile phone encourage children to use them and lack of concentrate their study and stop to think critically.On the other hand, many general people belive that mobile phone is best way to save their children. Actually, these is many cased caused by using the mobile phone such as kidnap in Japan.Children using smartphone to use SNS and contact with someone. In this situation, it is possible to someone contact with child and do the kidnap. Mobile phone is extremely useful but it can be dangerous exsist for children.In conclusion, mobile phone is very useful and convinient, but it has a lot of disadvantage that harm their eyes, promote lack of concentrate and kidnap. Hence, children who aged 8 - 12 years old should not use mobile phone.	4	3	4	3	3	3
300481896	There is an increasing number of children aged 8 - 12 use their mobile phones to contact to friends and parents recent years. It is not uncommon for seeing children are playing phones all the time not only at home or outside. The parents provide them a cell phone in order to communicate with their kids when they go out initially. However, the smart functions that the mobile phones possessed look to change the situation. In my opinion, I disagree with children aged 8 - 12 should use a mobile phone due to the harmful consequence and addictation of phones.Children health would be harmed if they spend too much time on playing a cell phone, especially for their eyes. It is obvious that there are over half students need to wear glasses on the class in China currently. The reason is they use the phone for a long time after their class and also not only communicate with their friends and parents. Most of the time they just use phones surfing online.Additionally, there has a high potencial for children aged 8 - 12 to be addicted to the mobile phone. With the development of technology, the smart phone has numerous functions, which could even replace the computer. Thus, a lot of children just use it to play games or watch videos. Sometimes they could play games with their friends together for a whole day. Because of the attractive games or other things they cannot focus on this study anymore, which would also impact their study and concentration of class. Furthermore, they have no ability to manage their time well. So, to some extend, it is a dangerous thing for children to play phones for long time.It is true that it's very convenient for parents to communicate with their children by using mobile phone. However, the disadvantages overweight the advantages. They can provide their kids some special phones, which are only designed for children. These phone just have the function of call, hence, it could ensure their safety and also not be addicted to the games.In conclusion, because of some drawback for children aged 8 - 12 to use mobile phones, such as harmful to their body and mental health, children should use other kind of methods to contact to their friends and family. The watch phone is efficient way to replace the smart phone.	5	4	5	5	4	5
300482646	Nowadays, with the development of technology, many children who aged 8 t- 12 are given a phone to contact with their family and friends. But I disagree with the use of mobile phones for 8 - 12 year old children because they are too young to prevent themselves from a phone which has attractive thing in it.Most children aged 8 - 12 May not control themselves and they are attracted to some addictive games which is designed for them. They need mobile phones to communicate with their family and friends becourse the long distance between home and school, so the children are probably out of their parents eyes and they can do whatever they want, they may play games with their friends and classmates. They may have no mind on assessment and waste time and games.The other significant reason is that the content in mobile phone may be harmful to the children. The children aged 8 - 12 are curious about new things and they are brobably influened by some unhealthy content as well as bad for the development of their mental healthy. Additionally, they are so young that may not identify which is good people in which are not, so the bad stranger would use mobile phone to damage young children. Therefore, it is also a dangerous thing for children aged 8 -12 to hold their mobile phone.Other people say that children aged 8-12 hold a phone would contact with their parents when they need. Furthermore, it is convenient for parents to communicate their children when the children are out. However, using phone may bad for the children aged 8- 12 to manage their time and influenced their healthy if they are addited to play game at home instead of doing some excerses in the garden. Therefore, the adventages are far outweigh disadvantages.To sum up, the children aged 8- 12 hold a phone are not only bad for their mental healthy and also giving a difficulty for them to manage their time.300491409 (4 min)In recent years, a great deal of degital productions make the public life more convenient. But the problem is that should many children aged 8-12 use mobile phones, which brought more attention to the whole society. As far as I am concerned, I tend to agree with the use of mobile phones for 8- 12 year old children.Using mobile phones for 8- 12 year old children exert positive on their life. First of all, the children are able to use phones to gain a wide variety of information, knowledge and current news that actually useful. In addition, children can use phones to keep in touch their family and friends wherever and whenever, that also ensure children's safety to some extent. Also, using mobile phones cultivate children skills of time management which is absolutely essential. Children need to consider spend how much time on their phone screen. However, phones using bring nemerous benefits to the children aged 8- 12 now.From another perspective, using mobile phones in advance also bring some defects to these group of children. We know that the stage of 8-12 year is the growing stage for children, if children spend much time on the phone screen, their eyesight will be hurt and have a risk of using phones to addicted.To sum up, using mobile phones for 8-12 year old children have various of merits. The children need spend reasonable time on it that will make children's life more convenient and wonderful.	4	4	3	3	4	3
300491415	There is a general discussion today about the issue of allowing children (aged 8-12) use cell phones or not. Some people believe that is a good way for children to communicate with their family and friends, while other people claim that the disadvantages of it are more than the advantages. I tends to agree with the second point of view, because children might becoming phone addict and getting some negative habbits from the internet.Fist of all, compared with adults children are more easy to be influenced but other people’s opinion. Because of children's brain are not mature, they always had poor judgment and identify the right and wrong about one thing. Sometimes, children who shows bad behaviors just because they learn them form the internet and they think it is ‘cool’ - such as the alcohol abuse and smoking at illegal age. Therefore, parents and teachers should limit the frequency of using mobile phones buy children to avoid their children or students get the bad influence from the internet.Secondly, it is know to all that in nowadays mobile phones’ function nearly the same as the computer. Children can use their phones to play games, watch TV, get more friends which they does not meet even once time, listen to music and so on. So many thing they can do by using their cell phones. That is why a huge amount of children get phone addict. They cannot concentrate to their class, their study and they even does not want to chat with their parents, because they think parents does not understand them.Althoug there are so many disadvantages about allowing children use mobile phones, people still cannot ignore the convience of using cellphone. For example, they could let children chating with people more effectively. But it also means that they will be influenced by more people.Overall, I strongly believe that people should not allowing	3	4	4	4	3	3
300414886	Nowadays, there are many benits to use mobile phones in our daily life, but it also bring some disadvantages to people. Although many children aged 8 to 12 now use mobile phones to communicate with their family and friends. Mobie phone will damaged their eyes. Children will spend too much time to use their mobie phone and it will give too much bad information to children.Firstly, mobie phones will damage their eyes, if they use their mobie phone too much in the same time. If they don't take a rest to use mobie phones, they will feel tired, and their eyes will be damaged.Secondly, children will spend too much time to use mobie phones, because they will play games in mobie phones. According to this point, mobie phones will let children spend too much time to use mobie phone, and they will not control themselves. Because of their age, they will not control themselves both parents don't limit their time to use mobie phones.Finally, mobie phones will give children too much bad information, because they can research any information in the internet by mobie phones.

Children will spend too much time to use mobie phones. Mobie phone will give too much bad information for them, it will avoid their behaviors.	3	3	4	3	3	3
300433944	Nowadays more and more people have their own mobile phones to use, in this situation some parents give their children cell phones to use to let them have communication with parents. In my opinion I think this is a good thing, because children can use their mobile phones to search the information on the internote this is good for their study, secondly as children can use cell phones to communicate with others.On the first point is cell phones can help children learning. As for the age and eight to 12 year old children, most of them do not like study in free time, but if they have cell phones, parents can help them in download some interesting apps about study, this will let children have interest in how to study. And young children in this age always fell of questions, if parents help them and how to search on the internet children will know it and do it by themselves. Something is told by others cannot let you remember it, only you know it by yourself then you will keep it in your memory, so let children have their own mobile phones can really help them and study and learning.Secondly cell phones can help kids in communication. Nowadays many kids do not know how to communicate with others because they are afraid of talk with each others face to face, but if they have mobile phones, they can communicate in some social apps with out face to face, after they fimiliar with each other, they can do it in real life, also children and eight to 12 year old age always face some dangerous in the past time they cannot connect with their parents and full and dangerous, however cell phones can help them with how to connect with parents, and this can really help them get over the dangerous situation. So I think let kids have their own mobile phones is neccary.On other hand some people think that kids do not have self concrol ability, So they will fall in internet And have addition with playing cell phones. This is a big problem for modern society, but some how people already come out with some ideas to deal with that. Like some mobile phones have parents model which can lead children can not save the things their parents do not want them to see, and some schools have ruels so that children use cell phones in schools. In these ways can help children in a right way.In my opinion I think young children use mobile phones is a normal thing in all over the world, parents can not limit their children in connect with internet, and the right way to deal with the situation is help them and lead them to use mobile phones in a right way.To sum up, the advantages of use mobile phones are more than disadvantages, so I agree with let young children use cell phones because cell phones can not only help them and study but also help them in their daily life, and I guess in future there will be more and more children have their own cell phones, and a large number of parents know the right way to help their kids use mobile phones.300445396 7 minRecently, it is very often to see children play mobile phones at home to chat with their friends, while some parents claim that their children might play their mobile phone for a long time, which can bring a lot of negative impacts to their children. In my opinion, children, (8 to 12 years old) should not be allowed to use mobile phone with others, because this might result in physical and mental problems for children.Firstly, over-using mobile phones can lead to physical problems to adolecents. Due to the lack of self-control, adolecents usually spend a long time on playing the smart phone, which obviously can harm to their eyesights and necks in the early stage. Besides, it is hard for parents to ask their children put down phones to do outdoor activities. This also can lead to physical problems such as overfat.In addition, children might be addicted in playing video games after they finish the snap chat. Due to the imatitive attribute of youngsters, those video games charecters might easily become youngsters’ role model. Therefore, youngsters might learn the violent behaviors from the video games, even result in juvenile crime after they grow up.On the other hand, we cannot deny the fact that sometimes children need to keep and touch with their parents and friends by mobile phone, because they might ecounter som problems which they cannot solve by themselves. However, when pupils are in the school, they can apply the help from teachers, or they can connect with their parents through teachers. On the other hand, when they are at home, they can use the house phone to chat with their friends.In conclusion, although some families are facing the dilemma that it is hard to balance the time their children spend on electrict devices. In my opinion, children should not have their own mobile phones to communicate with others due to the lack of self-control.	5	4	5	4	4	4
300448682	With the development of the electronic devices, everyone can keep a mobile phone with them. Does the advantages can overcome the disadvantages for children who are age 8 to 12 using mobile phones. Some people argue that children should have a phone to communicate with their family and friends. However, I disagree with them because it will also bring several negative effects such as inducing children addicted to the internet and leading them to do something illegaly.First of all, with the advent of the internet, more and more people are relying on it, especially for children. Children don't have a good self-control and they can have access to internet easily nowadays. For example, a children can easily use their mobile phones to play online games while they are having class. Due to the a large mount students studying in the class, teachers can not cure about every student in the classroom. Children's brain are still in the developing stage, so they don't know what they should do and what they can't do sometimes. Therefore, because of the lack of self-control for children, the mobile phones are not good for them to use.In addition, using mobile phone for children may lead them commite crimes. As we all know, there are a huge number of violent information about news, movies and even music. Equiping mobile phone for children make causes exposuring the violence to children at a young age. In the developing stage of their brain, children can easily learn something what they saw and what they met. When they watching violent movies or skimming violent information, they probably can learn from it. In the long run, they will commite crimes as what they learn from the movie. It's better for children to get away from mobile phones in case of exposuring to violence at a young age.Some people argue that it's good for children using mobile phones to chat with their family and friends. There is no doubt that children are really busy at school in their studying age and they also need to have a good relationship with other friends, classmates and their parents. Talking to others can help them dealing with stress. However, in my opinion, the mobile phones not only can't help them to keep a good relationship with others, but also lend to a isolation problem. If all of children only using their mobile phones to talk to each other instead of chatting face to face, they will feel alone because that is not real talk. When two people who talked to each other online meet on the road, they will feel strange. The relationship is based on the real life and it's not rely on the mobile phones.In conclusion, due to children have less self-control and a large amount violent information on the internet, it's better for child aged 8 to 12 to keep a distance with mobile phones. Using mobile phones to communicate with their family and friends it's not a good way to build relationship and help them deal with strees. In the future, I hope that children will pay more attention to their study not only focusing on using mobile phones.300451442 7 minThese days, children aged 8 to 12 tend to use mobile phone to communicate with their family and friends more than before and some people agree with that children use mobile phone. However, I disagree with this opinion because children may use mobile phone too much and face some problems.Firstly, children may use their mobile phone too much because they can use some app on their phone. Nowadays, mobile phones have several options and people even play game with their phones. If children start playing the games on their phone, they will use phone long time per day and they also may not play outside. In addition, because they can communicate with their family and friend any time and any where by using phone, the time which they touch their phone will increase and the time which they can touch the nature or study their subjects will decrease. This is very serious problem for children growing.Secondly, if children can use mobile phone, the risks which they face will rise. For example, children may see that dangerous websites like violence information and some of them will be influenced by it because children aged 8 to 12 do not have knowledge to select true and false information correctly and they are likely to believe fake information more than adults. In addition, children who use mobile phone may face the problem of friendship. In fact, some children suffered from bullying through the phone. Because people can write the false information or private information on the website, some children hurt from them and there are even children who commit suiside. Using mobile phone have some risks for children and they may face mental illness through using mobile phones.On the other hand, some people think that children should have mobile phone because they can contact to their family and friends quickly when some emergency problems happen. Of course, that is true. However, children can use public phone or school phone instead of using their mobile phone. Children spend long time in their school and even if they go to other activities out of the school, some adults have their phones and children can communicate with their family by them. Although it is very useful to talk quickly by using mobile phone, it is more important to communicate face to face for children.In conclusion, if children have their mobile phone, they have some risks to face some physical problems. This is why, I disagree that children use mobile phone to communicate with their family and friends.300465862 7 minutesNowadays, and increasing numble of children use mobile phones to communicate with their family and friends. Some parents argue that it will damage their children's health. Other people think teenagers use social media have some benefits. So the question must to asked: Can children which 8 to 12 year old use mobile phones to communicate with their family and friends. In this essay I will argue that use mobile phones is a good way to communicate with their family and friends because they can keep in touch their family and search some study information easily and quickly.The first and important reason supporting my view is that teenagers can communicate with their parents in time when if they have emergence situation. Therefore, their family can know where my children and what is my children doing. Their parents do not need to worry about their safe just a call. In addition, it is a good way to communicate with their grandparents. Sometimes, the teenage lived with their parents and far away with their grandparents or some closely friends. They can keep in touch with those people.The second reason that students can find out information easily and quickly. It is difficult to search some information for them if they do not stay home without computers. And some parents can afford to buy a computer, so it is very hard to research some references for children. The mobile phones is both cheap and convenient, so a numble of people choose using phones to communicate with their family and friends. Some people argue that children aged 8 to 12 use mobile phones to communicate with people. Because it will damaged children's health and be addicate to the network. Based on truth, it will damage childrent's eyes and brain if they play long time. In addition, they may addicate to the Internet and do not study carefully. It is really have some disadvantages. However, I think use mobile phones have some benefits than negative effects. The children aged 8 to 12 can communicate with their family and friends through video or voice chat which cheap that call cost. In addition, they can immediate dial a call if they have some dangerous situation. These reasons is why I agree with the use of mobile phones for eight to 12 year old children.In conclusion, using mobile phones is really good way to communication even those who can not afford call costs can easily with their family and friends keep in touch in their break time. As for to some children is addicate to the games, it requires parents to educating and childrens improving awareness of self. In the future, I think the numble of teenagers use social media to communicate will increase and more popular.	5	4	5	5	5	5
300468100	Is it beneficial for children aged 8 to 12 to use mobile phone? Obviously, different people have there own opinions. In the early 2000s, mobile phones had not developed as well as nowadays. At that time, people only regarded mobile phones as a tool that people could communicate with other people by them. However, with the development of society and techpnolegy, mobile phones are not only a tool but also a necessaity in people's daily life, and all the people regardless of ages are interested in using them because of the convenient. As for children who are 8 to 12 years old, it is more important for them to get familiar with mobile phones.One of the most significant reasons is about children’s safety. Children especially primary school students are weak and likely to be attacked by criminals. They are always targets of some crime. Furthermore, they are more likely to be bullied by peers. It doesn't necessarily mean that all the children are under pressure of offending. If children are facing emergency, they can ask police or their parents for help as soon as possible. As a consequence, many crime can be avoided.On the other hand, in the modern society, information is changing frequently. Children aged 8 to 12 are the future of the country and society, and they need to acquire more knowledge from all aspects. In this context, children have to find some approaches to know more about the world to prevent them from lagging behind their peers. The most effective way to expand their outlook is using mobile phones. In fact, some scientists once said that mobile phone was one of the best invention in the 21st centry, because it provided another possibility for human to explore the world besides traveling and doing research.Some parents may think that mobile phones are harmful for children's eyesight. However, scientists have found that screens are not harmful for children, and what people think about mobile phone sometimes are not scientific. If parents still worry about the safety of mobile phones, they can limit their children using time of mobile phones.To sum up, mobile phones is a kind of electrical diverce, are significantly helpful for human’s development. In many cases, they play a necessary role in our life. As for children aged 8 to 12, they have special ability to learn about different information so mobile phones have shown their importances among children. Parents should find a substainable way for their children to use mobile phones. Moreover, mobile phones will become more and more importand in the future.	5	5	5	5	5	5
300469408	With the spread of advanced technology, almost everyone who needs to maintain his or her social relationship has a mobile phone, even some children included. It is apparent that using a phone is a must for the adult due to its inevitable merits, however, do the children aged 812 really to need to use mobile phone? My answer is yes, for they can not only communicate with their family and friends more easily, but they can also get benefits for their study as long as they could use mobile phones in a reasonable way.The first reason which can support my opinion is that children can contact with their parents and friends as soon as they need when using mobile phones. Safety is a concern that all parents will care about. So, not only could be children call their parents when some emergencies happen, but also they would have the chance to dial 111 to inform the police to help them. Hence, and awareness of self-protect can be developed. Furthermore, although children aged 8 to 12 seem too young to build interpersonal relationship, it is a skill which is supposed to start to train from their childhood. The earlier they get in touch with the outside world, the more masterly they could deal with various kinds of issues when they grow up.The second foremost reason to support my view is the children aged 8 to 12 can use their cellphones to gain useful information to benefit their learning. The parents should play the role such as an instructor when their children meet any difficulties during they are doing homework. However the reality is that a large number of parents are busy with their own work, and they are also lack of knowledge to solve academic problems for their children, let alone give helpful instructions. Therefore, the significant usage of mobile phones - going through the Internet - can be more effective for the children.However, there are still a huge number of parents holding the belief that it is a harm for their children to use mobile phone, saying that it will not only be a threaten to health condition of their eyes, but also the violent pictures or crime videos could have impact on the growth of their children. But it can be solved if the parents set a time limit to use mobile phones for their children, and block the websites which have the potential to show violent photos in advanced.In conclusion, children aged 8 to 12 should be allow to use mobile phone to communicate with their family and friend, and do some useful searches to benefit their study.Nowadays, mobile phones are surrounding in people’s life. Many children aged 8 to 12 now use mobile phones to communicate with their family and friends. In my view, I disagree with the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children.First, the majority of children aged 8 to 12 they staty with their family. It will reduce their time to get together with their family and friends if they use mobile phone to communicate. Communicating face to face instead of using words through phones. It also can practice their impression skills. Second, those children's bodies are developing. It is bad for their eyes if they use mobile phones for a long time. Next, these children study in schools. So they cannot focus on this study with mobile phones. Because, there are a lot of information on the phones. Many children are interested in it. However, there are also some bad and unhealthy news on the phones. The children are too young to avoid them. Maybe they will be effected by these unhealthy news and they cannot pay attention to their study.In addition, some people think using mobile phones to communicate with their family and friends also have benefits. Some children they stay away from their family and friends. Using mobile phones is a good way to have a good connection with them. Besides, using using words can practice children's brains. Because, those aged children's memories are the strongest. They can increase a lot of knowledge through using mobile phones.All in all, children aged 8 to 12 using mobile phones is a way to communicate with their family and friends. But we cannot ingoned these drawbacks surrounding children. I think parents should pay more attention about their children who use mobile phone and spend more time to communicate with their children face to face.	5	5	5	4	5	5

Especially in people from 8 to 12 the are rizons why some parents give to their chiid mobile phone for example to communicate with their famiy howerer in my opinion the use of mobile phones should be over 12 years old.The first reason to support my opinion is that chiid from 8 to 12 tend to spend a lot time playing on their phones and they not spend enough time in their study so their study mark may be low because they are distrated by the mobile phonesThe second reason is that chiid between 8 to 12 they haven't enougn knowledge to do good manages in their mobile phone for example sometimes their can login on pages where other people can send then violent games so their mind can lead to bad people and bad thinking and also the verbal communication with the people who are around them may decreased because they might no want to spend their time talking while they can be doing forever they want online.The age to use mobile phones should be over 12 because the person should be aware of the responsability of using it some people believe that they should give to their chiid mobile phone to communicate with their friends. but, about 50 years ago where there where no quanty of availabity of mobile phone people use others method to communicate with their friends and family with out many problems such as writing a latter.In conclution: the used of mobile phones is good for people who can do a good use I know that today day mobile phones a part of our daily life such as in our work to communicate with people but we maight think about the right age to give mobile phone to our chiid and for the new generation we should teach them that the verbal communication to other people face to face is more important than loss our time playing games in our mobile phones.	4	4	4	3	4	4

Some people believe that mobile phones deprive time to study from children and mobile phones can be harm for children aged 8 to 12. However, In my opinion, children aged 8 to 12 have positive effect on using mobile phones.First, children aged 8 to 12 may gain useful information from mobile phones. For example, in older to finish homework, children may gain useful information about homework from mobile phones. In other words, children gain many interesting or informative knowledge with mobile phones. Compared to using dictionary, mobile phones provide children with useful information easily.Second, mobile phones help to reducing children stress. For example, mobile phones have many entertayment things such as movie, book or game. In addition, mobile phones provide many free app for children. Therefore, it is suggest that children gain fullfill or happiness by mobile phones. Mobile phones in rich children's life.However, some people suggest that it is not necessary for children to use mobile phones. This is because, mobile phones deprive time of sleeping. For example, if children use mobile phones before go to bed, children may not sleep easily. In other words, Mobile phones have a weaknesses points for children health. In addition, some people argue that mobile phones deprive time of studying from children. For example, if children dependent on using mobile phones, it would be difficult for children to concentrate on study. However, if parents manage to childrens schedule of use mobile phones or manage the time of study, the problem of using mobile phones may be resolved.In conclusion, the rate of using mobile phones by children will continue to increase. However, due to advanced technology, mobile phones provide benefit for children. Therefore, it is suggest that people may have to agree with the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children.	4	4	4	3	4	4
300478184	People nowadays around the world have mobile phones to communicate with friends, family or people who use social networking services, and to enjoy their private lives playing games or watching videos. The more mobile phones are evolved and developed, the wider the users of ages get. The mobile phone can make people's life more fulfilling with its functions and connect people around the world while it also has unfavorable aspects. However, I think children aged 8 to 12 should not use mobile phones for society and their health.The first reason for support my idea is that there are various kinds of online crimes and they are becoming more seriously and invisibly. Adult users have knowledge how to prevent their mobile phones from crimes and how to deal with it, however, young childlen don't have the knowledge and they use mobile phones with their curious heart. The targets that online criminals aim are mostly elderly people or younger childlen who don't know about dangerousness of using mobile phones. These days to security functions to protect these people are created, but parents cannot check and monitor their childlen what they are using every time.The second reason is that light from mobile phone disturbed the growth of young children who don't grow up well. For example, blue light of mobile phone affects the eyesight of good development. The time that childlen use the mobile phones get longer unless parents control the time. Larger numbers of childlen may not become adult with health body.Anti-scientists says mobile phones lit younger childlen to communicate with their family whatever happens such as natural disasters. Parents can check where their childlen are or keep in touch with them every time. However, the mobile phone has the limit to use because it needs energy charge. Younger childlen don't have to use mobile phones.In conclusion, mobile phone has some bad effect for young childlen in terms of social and health. Another function to communicate with their parents should be created in the future.	4	4	4	3	4	4

There are positive and negative points to have them. In my opinion, I agree with using of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children. There are two reasons. Firstly, it is safety for children and their family. Secondly they can learn about risks of the use of mobile phones.The first reason to support my opinion is that using mobile phone provides safety to children in their family. By communicating with their family, families can know where children are. Also, if they can not communicate with their children, most of mobile phones have GPS, so their family can know the location of children then they feel safety.The second reason to support my opinion is that children can study about risks of using mobile phones. It is a important step to use mobile phones adequately in adult. Most of eight to 12 year old children spend a lot of time with their family. In other words, their family can take care of them closely. Therefore, if children face risks or problems with friends or someone by mobile phones, their family can teach risks to their children and children can have skills not to face problems again.Some people say that the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 years old children have bad impacts on their study skills and morals because mobile phones have some fun applications. It is true that some application lead to bad influences for children. However, their family who are worry about their children can change settings of their children's mobile phones. In addition, recently, some mobile phone companies provide new phones for children. Their products have alarm not to use for a long time and their family can get some information about how long their children use mobile phones. Therefore, their family do not need to be worry about their children’s bad influences.In conclusion, the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children have good points. The first point is that mobile phones provide safety to children and their family. The second point is that children can study risks from their family before they head mobile phone and adults. In the future, more and more young children will have mobile phones and It is a necessary tool to communicate with their family and friends.	4	4	4	4	4	4

For instance, if the child was absent in the school the good and faster way to know any important thing or homework is by communicate with friends.The second important reason that support my opinion is mobile phones are faster way to communicate with family in dengrous situation, for instance, if child went out with friends then lost immediatly the child will communicate with family for help.The final reason is mobile phone could be useful way to increase the responsibility amoung children when the child feel that phone is mine then usually notice the battery of the phone so, child would be grow with high responsibility of things that belong to.Other people claim that mobile phones with children cause addiction. When children spend more time dealing with them.

For example, if the student parents being late to pick up their children from the school, the student can call his parents to know if they are coming or find some way to pick the student to the home.In addition, If there is an accident or something wrong happened in the school, student could call his caregiver to let them know about the situation because sometimes it's hard for the school manegement to call all the parents at the same times.Another important point of giving the children mobile phone is to communicate with friends. Furthermore, it is very helpful to let the children communicate with his or her friends to build his personality. For instance, due to the student absence in the school, student can text their friends to give him the task and to explain for him or her anything missed in the school.Some people think that it is not important to give the children mobile phone because he can use his parents mobile or ask anyone of his or her old brother to give him too.

There is no doubt that the best choice is to allow 8 to 12 aged children to use mobile phones. Children of these ages may not have enough power to protect themselves as well as dealing with some sudden events. They need help from their family members and friends. As a result, mobile phones came to the best choice. On one hand, children can easily learn to use mobile phones for keeping in touch with others. When some happends, but they do not know what to do. They can only dial a telephone number in order to ask the police for help. On the other hand, children at these ages would not like to be alone. They need peers and friends to get along with.

Children can use mobil phones very easily and build strong friendship by communicate with their friends on their phones, and their parents can always check their safety by their smartphone. But other people believe that children between 8 to 12 always have poor self-control so they may not focus on their study because of mobile phones. Today I will argue that children between 8 to 12 can use mobile phones, if their parent control better, smart phone will be a useful equipment for them.There are three reasons why mobile phones can be used by children. Firstly, with the development of high-technology, most of people communicate with others by using social medias on their mobile phone. Children between 8 to 12 also need to social, They can use their smartphones to build stronger friendship with their classmates or teachers. They can share their interesting things or talk about their hobby. They are only a few people and today society don't use mobile phones, that means mobile phone is the best way for children to communicate with others.Secondly, safty problem of children between 8 to 12 is very common in today. Violent incident always appear in primary school. Have children met some dangers, they can phone others for help. Parents Can also search their mobile phone location and find their children, so mobile phones make children safter. The last point is children can acquire more knowledge by using their smartphone. They can read news more efficiency and get informations which they want.There are also some positive things of children between 8 to 12 using mobile phones. The main point is the screen on mobil phone would hurt children's eyes, it must be a nagative thing for children. Another point is children between 8 to 12 should focus on their study. Study is their main mission, because of their poor self control, they may playing games or watching vedios on their phones and forget their study plan. It is also harmful.Children between 8 to 12 using mobile phones or not depends on their teachers and parents. Teachers and parents should teach children the right view of using mobile phones. They can control the time children using mobile phones, and they can force their children using mobil phone without games. Mobile phones are not harmful for children, but parents and teachers should set strict rules to make some mobile phones will always have good influence to children. Then mobile phones will help children a lot.In conclusion, I always believe that children between 8:00 to 12:00 should use mobile phones to communicate with their parents. Bible phones are convinent to use and it can also make children safter. If parents control the way their children using mobile phones better, those negative things will not effect their children's growth, so children between 8 to 12 should use mobile phones to communicate with their family and friends.	5	5	4	5	4	5
300490889	Nowadays, the public are paying more attention to the situation about their children use phone, which has been hardly seen ever before, because there are many aspects influence children's life by using phone. In my mind, I argue with the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children, they couldn't control themselves to playing mobile phone in right time and it also harmful to their health. However, the children should learn how to use the high technique equipment. They should use the reliable phone after 12 years old.First and foremost, the children who are 8 to 12 years old don't have ability to control themselves when they are playing mobile phone games and they always devote themselves to the playing things during that time, result to they maybe would pay the whole day to playing phone. Even for adults, sometime they will spend very long time for the mobile phone without attention, such as, as the report showed a news that an old man forget to close door because watched the phone then theif took his some values from his house. Even the adults couldn't control themselves for the phone sometimes, as the 8 to 12 year old children that always want to play games all day more difficult to control themselves for playing mobile phone. Due to they couldn't control the time of playing mobile phone, it is harmful to their eys and health that spend too much on the mobile phone games. Some scientists said the children prefer to playing the electronic games rather than do exercise. Especially for the 8 to 12 year old children, they need much exercise for their development of their body.Of course, in the modern society, it is necessary to learn how to use high-technique equipment for children. Earlier they learn, but earlier they could use it to learn other knowledge. The trend of using smartphone and every family it's very normal for the world.Last but not least, the mobile phone is a double-side sword, but it could benefit for your development of knowledge and vision if you could use it in proper ways. It is clear that the most children who are 8 to 12 year old don't have ability to control themselves, so the adults should teach their children how to play phone in right way or have plan to using phone, then let the children have their own phone.After 12 years old, the children would have some ability to control themselves, in that time, it would have positive effect for their life and right way.In conclusion, I disagree with the use of mobile phone for 8 to 12 year old children who are always want to relax during that time.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300479205	nowadays, with the development of technology, mobile phones are more and more popular in our lives. Especially for using of smartphones, some kids between 8 and 12, preferred to use mobile phones to communicate with their family and friends. I agree with the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children.Firstly, it is convenient for children to use mobile phones to communicate with their families and friends. If children could have mobile phones, it will be hard to get lost. According to my experience, when I was a child, my mother bought me a mobile phone. If I wanted to go somewhere such as my friends’ house, I would have a phone call to my family. They didn't worry about it if I get lost because I can use a phone to connect with him in anywhere or anytime. It is useful because my family knows where I am.Secondly, children could use smartphones to search or scan some knowledge which they want to know immediately. About 10 years ago, there were no smartphones. So I have to use computer or go to library in order to find some information which I need. For a student, it spent a lot of time on searching information and knowledge. However, we can easily find them by using mobile phones. Each smartphone provide link of internet, when A child needs some help, he or she can find almost everything on smartphones. Smartphones can reduce a lot of time to search something.Some people disagree with the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children because they think children cannot control themselves and easily attracted by medias. Not all of the things on mobile phone are valuable. Some harmful information can not guide children to a good way. More and more children use mobile phones too much because they like communicating with their friends on the Internet. In my opinion, these disadvantages could be avoided. Children between 8 and 12 need more guides from their parents but not smart phones. Parents should teach their children how to use phones in a correct way which replace making children no ways to communicate with others. It is seen as many children like the development of technology so they want to have a mobile phone. Why don't their parents teach them how to use it?in conclusion, there are more advantages than disadvantages of using mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children. In their lives, they need keep their relationship with their family and friends.300482320 (incomplete)I disagree many children aged 8 to 12 use mobile phone. There are major three reasons.Firstly is if children could use mobile phones, almost children could not focus study. Because we can many applications like SNS, email and games in mobile phones. In old type of mobile phone can use only when we call to other people, but recently mobile phone can not only call but also play game with other people, take photos and use internet. Because there are many functions with recently mobile phones. So, many children are tend to focus on play games and use SNS and as a result, many children can't focus study. In other words, mobile phones makes interfere of children study and education, even if their parents give children to communicate with other people.Secondly is mobile phones makes children mind control. Now, many people users SNS such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. These SNS can contact with other people easy, but almost people come to mind which compare with other people. For example, Instagram can look other people's picture, some people compare with other people's quority of picture and quantity of “good!”. And mobile phones have addiction. In fact, Japanese almost children use smart phones for four or five hours per day, according to other study.Finally it's can leads to bully easy. In recently in Japan, that is big social problem. In Japan, almost people use “LINE”. This is chat application, and almost children use to communicate with family and children. But, this chat application can leads to bully. This bully is difficult to quit because surrounded adults like teachers and parents can't find. And bullyed side leads to suiside at worst. Of course, mobile phones is	5	5	4	4	4	4
300484040	Many children aged from 8 to 12 use mobil phones to communicate with their family and friend. Some people agree but in my point of view I disagree strongly because there is no need for buying them mobile phones and there are many reasons support my opinion.First, children from 8 to 12 are still younger and they may not appreciate the value of getting mobile phones. In addition, they can use a telephone to communicate with their parents if there is a necessity and their parents at work. Moreover, those children won't be allowed to go outside without one of their parents.Second, it might be a financial burden felt by some families to bring mobile phones for every child. In Saudi Arabia many families bring mobiles for each one of their children. At first, the child is very happy to have a mobile Like the other children in the same age but this is developed and the child doesn't satisfy with the oldest one and he wants a newest and latest edition. So, that causes a financial burden for lots of families.Third, children may use it differently. They can download games and different applications. It is very hard to prevent your child from playing games. In addition it is very hard to observe your child in every time that he spends in using mobiles.On the other hand, some people argue that children from 8 to 12 use mobile phones to communicate with their families and friends because there is a need to communicate in every time and maybe their parents are separated. So, he can communicate with their mother or father directly. Also, they argue that they can observe their child usage by download some sequity programs that help them to watch what their child does.From my experience, I don't allow to bring mobiles for my children but sometimes I give them my mobile. I notice changing in their behaviors. They become easy to cry. They become very naughty because they watch some Youtubers behave very badly and they imitate them. After that, I tried to prevent them and if they behave very well and politly, I can give them my mobile for half an hour. I can choose the content for them and I watch with them together.To sum, our children are honest and we must bring them very well. Mobile phones has more disadvantages than the advantages. It's just better to avoid your children from using mobiles until they become old enough.	3	4	4	4	4	4
300484277	There are a lot of technologies have been discovered in our world. One of these technologies is the mobile. Mobiles become most important device in human life. The Attractive designs of phones make everyone want to have one. Several children aged 8 to 12 use Smart phone nowadays and there are several Families accept that. I completely disagree with giving children aged 8 to 12 phones.The dangerous affects of using smart phones rose. Most of parents gave their children mobiles in order to be in contact with them. But these caused several problems. Children from age 8 to 12 are still very young and it is not acceptable to have phones. These aged should be under care from their parents. Phones caused a lot of health diseases such as super active that a lot of school suffer from that. Children lose their control and started to do harm things for theirselves and their friends or families.Some families gave their children phones in order to keep them queit when they go to visit someone. Children and these ages like to play and move but families didn't want them to bother them or the others. By giving the children smart phone that will kill their creative and let them suffer from health and society problems. This will also harm their eyes. The parents have to be awareness and don't give their children mobiles in these important ages.Some families said that the smartphone have smart applications and useful things which make their children learn new things and follow the technology but these also must to be limited and controled. There are a lot of games and applications harmed children and also kill some by giving them attractive things to do it until they reach to the hard and dangerous point. A lot of its stories were about young children who used phones without controling which caused problems make their families said forever.There are several things families can gave to their children such as smart games that make the child think and build something by using their hands. Such these games form the brain and let the children be more creative and smart in schools. The parents have to think in the health of their children and be aware of the dangerous affects of these smartphones.In conclusion, the world in the future need intellegent young. The children nowadays are the young of the future. Families must help them to be the man of the future.	4	3	3	3	4	3
300485722	In this era use mobile phones as particularly normal and it is not important the age to use it. Mobile phones are one of the creations of technology therefore through the time it has advanced constantly. As a result children are fascinating because of the new advanced. Some adults opinions is that mobile phones may be banned two children aged 8 to 12. Faithful from other points of view children should be communicate with their parents through mobile phones. Nonetheless this essay will argue that mobile phones may disrupt children learning and the can be at online risk.The first idea to support the statement is that mobile phone may disrupt children learning. Mobile phones provide differents way to have fun as an example games and social media, apps. While a child are using mobile can be concentrate having fun as a result they maybe avoid their studies. It can be suggest that children may bring their mobile phone to school because of this teachers may have problem while they are teaching for the lack of children attention. Nevertheless Mobile phones can have a negative impact in children learning and it can be challenge to teacher maintain their attention.Children can be at Online risk while they are using mobile phones. Today children can be connected to the internet more compared with years ago because of the new advanced of the technology. This can be a way to children be it Online risk so many places such as colleges, universities, supermarkets between others provide WiFi to usuers. As a result children can take approach of this advantages to be connected taking them on risk of abuse through the internent. Some parents may experience some issues related with the internet as an example bulling, that is caused through the Iinternet four people.Some people believe that children may be communicate with their families through mobile phones. A significant amount of people are agree with the participation of mobile phones in children life because this is a way to children be communicate with their parents. Also mobile phones are part of the society in this days. However People may not aware of the issues that can be caused from mobile phones. As a result they may provide mobile phones to their childs thinking and security but putting them at risk.In conclusion mobile phones can be a way to stop children age 8 to 12 learning. Mobile phones may bring more problems to families and solutions so for this reason parents could stop giving mobile phones to children in this age. Other way to be communicate can be email and parents may monitore the children easier being in a computer than mobile phones=============================	4	3	3	4	3	3
300469240	Nowadays, cigarettes become a serious problem in the world. It obvious many people can buy every shop which make life harmful. Many companies can get profit by selling in our society. However, many people stat that there are an increasing the number of people die caused by cigarettes has more disadvantages than benefits because it make health problem, pay a lot of money for buy it and make environment problem.The 1st and most important to support my opinion that there are very high number of people die. Caused by toxic of accumulation of cigarettes. For example cancer and lung problem stop Moreover, some people pegnent get effect from smoking cigarettes then make baby help problem as well. Particularly, many money pay a lot for health careThe second reasons support my opinion that people pay money a lot to buy cigarettes in their daily life. Even many companies control the regulation from government. Companies or manufacture must do logo or picture on the top of cigarettes but people still buy cigarettes and pay a lot of moneyThe final reason support my opinion that environment problem because make a lot of pollution air in our society. many cigarettes make some people bad habit through garbage. For example road river.In conclusion, this problem required to government and producer’s responsibility extend also	3	4	3	3	3	3
300471151	With the increasing of income, people are more likely to spend money on cigarettes. People who rely on cigarettes heavily smoke one pack of cigarettes every single day. Those companies which manufacture cigarettes gain a large amount of money from their products. Some people argue that government should limit cigarettes companies by higher tax. However, in my opinion, cigarettes manufacture companies should pay money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking.This first reason to support my opinion is that, many cancers are a result of smoking. There are many adverse impacts on smoking, especially on people's health. People who smoking for a long time are more likely to have cancer, for example, the cancer on lung is a common disease because of smoking. However, the cigarettes gain a large profit from their cigarettes. Therefore, cigarettes should pay money for those people who suffer from cancer, because of smoking.The research fund is the second reason to support my opion that cigarettes should pay money as compensation to people suffering from cancer. It is obvious that there is a huge experience on researching how to prohibit the cancer. Many researchers devote to research new medical technique to solve the problem of cancer. however, it need a large amount money for researching new medicines. If those companies which manufacture cigarettes are required to pay the bill for researching cancer, it would help the process of researching the cancer problems.In contrast, although smoking is a individual choose, some people argue that no one can be pushed to smoke. In fact, the negative effect is not just on the people who smoke cigarettes. According to research about family that had nearly one person smoking, the other families members could also be affected of smoking. This means that second-hand smoking has bad effects on people who are not smokers.In conclusion, cigarettes companies should pay money for people who develop cancer from smoking for its bad effects on health. There are all kinds of bad things in the cigarettes, and these bad materials can be absorbed by smoking and transferred to people. Those cigarettes companies gain lots of money, but bring healthy problems to people. Therefore, they should pay money as compensation for people who develop cancer from smoking.	5	5	4	5	5	5
300478180	Currently, people who smoke tend to decrease all over the world. There are a lot of risks because of smoking, so smokers should stop smoking. I will argue that it is good idea companies should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking because of costing a lot and bad for our health.Firstly, it costs a lot to buy cigarettes. In my country, cigarettes of price changed recently. These changed four hundreds yen to five hundreds yen. If we smoke a box everyday, where you might pay fifteen thousands yen per month. Per year, we might pay one hundred eighty thousands yen. It is too much for us.Secondly, smoking is bad for our health. Cigarettes are contained so many harmful things. It is very dangerous not only smokers but also non smokers. Also, smokers tend to show symptoms of serious ills, short temper, selfishness, losing perspective, eagerness of learning and so on. Especially, it is too terrible for women who have babies in their stomach babies might not be born activity.On the other hand, smokers love cigarettes like children love snacks. Smokers worked hard, then they smoke because it is relaxable to smoke for them. They might think people who smoke are very cool especially, men.In conclusion, it is good idea that companies should pay large amounts of money. I think the number of smokers are decreasing because high costs, getting serious ills, but there are many smokers in the world, so companies have to pay more money and then smokers need to stop smoking. I think healthy life is the best way to our life. Everyone have to live on comfortable.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300476975	I think that companies which manufacture cigarettes pays large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking is very good idea.Today, a lot of cities, shops are separating smoking area in the world. And the price of cigarettes gradually increased. Therefore, people who smoking are decreasing now.If companies which manufacture cigarettes pays a lot money, people who don't smoking get a lot benefit. Firstly, people who don't smoking will increase more and more.To pay a lot of money for people means becoming higher the price of cigarettes. I think it will also happen to decrease people who smoking.In addition, I believe that the number of people who have an cancer or a lot of disease by cigarettes will decrease.On the other hand, many people will disagree to this idea. Because only people who don't smoking have profits. And of course, the companies should pay a lot of money. I think the important point is reliability. Companies or people who smoking. Which has the reliability of cancer problem. I think both.In my conclusion, companies should pay a lot of money as compensation. But people who smoking also should pay money as compensation. And, everyone related to smoking should have reliability.	4	4	4	3	3	4
300478707	Generally, the number of people who have cancer from smoking is increasing and we see the people who use cigarettes somewhere. Some people describe that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from speaking, it seems good idea. There are the reasons below that supporting the idea.At first, it costs not only much money but also take a long time in order to treat cancer. Do you know how much costs to treat the cancer from smoking? Actually, it costs a large amounts of money. For instance, my uncle was heavy smoker and he took a lot of cigarettes in a day so he got cancer. He could get well by a treat but he lost a large amount of money. Because of the cigarettes from the company, he got the cancer. Therefore companies ought to pay the fee.Second, as you know, cigarettes have addiction so it is difficult to quite using it. In other word, the patients can't quite using it easily if they want to quite it. In the TV, we sometimes watch the documentary that people who worry about smoking addiction. They seem so annoyed about it and feel uncomfortable if they stop using it. The responsibility is in company without consumer who used cigarettes.Finally, they have cancer from smoking increase more, they can't live longer and it relates decreasing of population in the country. And contemporary society, the average die age tend to become short compared with previous the average of it. Nowadays, it is extremely big problem in all over the world, so in order to live longer, company stop this tendency by paying money that treat the cancer for people who have cancer.To sum up, the responsibility of having cancer is not an individuary person but in company that manufacture cigarettes that source of cancer. Therefore, companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking for consumer’s health.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300422495	Cigarettes become very common in our life. With the social development cigarette become main industry for some companies. Nowadays some companies make many cigarettes with cheap price. Most people easy to buy cigarettes. This situation brings some issues full of humans life like, some people develop cancer from smoking. Therefore some people think companies which industry cigarettes should pay mini for people who have cancer from smoking but I consider that companies shouldn't pay large amounts of money as compensation to people, because people develop cancer with cigarettes that isn't responsibility for companies and every adult could control themselve.Firstly people cancer with cigarettes that isn't responsible for companies. As a company that only make cigarettes and sell it. The company don't told people, which is nessery for people life. When people have big stress they will smoking. Therefore most time people smoking by themselve. for cigarettes company that neve tall people cigarettes, which have benefits for people's health. Therefore cigarettes shouldn't pay amounts of money is compensation to people.Secondly, every adult should have controlling ability. In some countries like New Zealand, only adult could buy cigarettes. Why adults different with children because most adults have controlling abilities. When that companies sell their cigarettes, every cigarettes has a sentence or bad pictures on the box. Therefore when the adults by a series, they aware the sentence meaning, so they should to control themselve without smoking. When a person become a adults they have controlling ability already. There when they got cancer, they to solve disease by themselve.Finally some believe that if many people develop cancer, if the company doesn't sell cigarettes then that the people can't a place to buy a cigarettes. In this way will less people develop cancer. Howeve, when people want to smoking, they will have many methods to get a cigarettes after that people develop cancer so stop it isn't responsibility to a company, so why a company need to pay compensation to people with smoking? Most cigarettes companies tall people smoking is very bad people's health.In conclusion, companies shouldn't pay money for people who develop cancer from smoking companies only make cigarettes keep health is compusry and responsibility for a person.	4	3	4	3	4	3
300445396	Today, there is an increasing number of people who are suffering from lung cancer due to the tobacco consumed. Therefore, somebody claim that the tobacco companies should take the responsibility and invest in the compensation for developing cancer. In my opinion, the tobacco companies should not take charge of that, because smoking is personal activity and the cigarette company might increase the price of tobacco to earn the money back.Firstly, smoking is personal activity. In other words, smokers should take charge of their health and give up to smoke. That means if people do not want to suffer from the cancer, they would chose to use electronic cigarettes even give up smoking. In addition, if the rate of cancer caused by the tobacco decline, more people might not fear to the health problems and start smoking in an young age. So, but best solution of reducing the rate of cancer is persuade people to give up tobacco. On the other hand, some people claim that the cigarette companies should invest in developing cancer because the companies are wealthy. We cannot deny the fact but the tobacco companies are wealthy and have the ability to develop cancer. However, the expendeture of cancer study might make no sense to them, thus they are not willing to do that. If they are asked to invest in the cancer study, they might increase the price of cigarettes. In other words, the investors are the smokers instead of the cigarette companies.In conclusion, smokers should take charge of their health and give up cigarettes, which is the best strategy to keep away from the lung cancer.	5	4	4	4	5	4
300446931	Since humanity entered the 21st centry, health issue has already became a big question for everybody. Currently, there is a widespread concern over the issue is that tobaccos’ companies needs spend large amount of money to help people deal with cancer from smoking. This essay will argue that tobaccos’ companies needn't pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking, Because cigarettes is consumers own choice and those companies has already helped lots of economic industrys develop.First of all, tobacco is consumers own opition. As we all know, cigarettes companies fundamental function is a company, which need earn the money. In economic theory, consum behavior will impact product. For example, nowadays a vast majority of tobacco companies will not have advertisement and also have some warning on it’s products, but still lost of consumer willing to spend a large of money on this and have cancer finally. In some, consumers behavior, especially for bad behavior, needn’t let companies pay for it.For the second view, a large number of cigarettes companies has already spent money on local area’s economic development. Ta Shan which is a popular cigarettes bround amoung Chinese consumer because of it’s approach prices. This companies localed in a very poor area in South west of China spite of the fact that it is a tobacco company. It still spend a large amount of money on local areas economic and education, and then helped that areas people have a happiness lifestyle. In the world, there still have lots of companies who like Ta Shan and we can't let them pay more, because they have already did it.On the contrary, some people think tobacco is the elements evil, if companies will not product it. Why some people will have carncers? It is currecy that cigarettes is a harmful product and lots of people don't like it, but like a saying ‘lives thing have their own theory’ most of consumer willing put money on it and it can help govenment get more tax. In many contries tobacco have a heavy tax and companies and consumers need pay some extar money on it, and so on, they needn't pay others like help cancer illness.In conclusion, this essay has argued that tobaccos’ companies needn't pay extra money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking because it's consumers own choice and tobacco’s companies has already did some positive things. In addition, if tobacco companies need be more sustainable, must do some thing and consumer need do it too.	5	4	5	4	4	4
300444606	Currently, smoking problem has become one of the most pressing issue on the international agenda. Compared with the past, a increase number of people have cancer because of smoking. It is generally accepted that companiese which produce cigaretts should pay certainly money for the health care of those smokers who buy their products. This method can not only reduce the economic burden of government, but also pay responsibilities for their consumers.First and foremost, tobacoo compaines can help government to solve a part of economic burden of public medical resources. Smokers have consumed a significant number of money to gain the treatment for their diseases, in particular the cancer. It has increased the economic burden of government, they have to spend a large amount of money to support the public medical resources. This means that government will reduce the investment for other social problems, such as education and transportation. Therefore, fat companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay a considerable money is compensation to those tobacoo consumers. It is a effective way to solve the deficit problem of government.Another reason is that cigarettes can be limited by compensation fees that companies must to pay. The cigarettes can make the companies to profit from sale and export, yet it will damage environment and the health of people. Some of countries want to limit the tobacoo industry through taxing, but it doesn't a effective method. If those companies have to pay money for their consumers health conditions, they will be limited to sale the cigarettes. This way is not only solve the limit of cigarettes saling problem, but also make that compaines have responsibilities for their consumers.Some people argue that the companies don't have to pay extra money for cancer patients due to smoking, they should responcible themselves. It is true that not every smoker will have cancer or other health problem. However, the companies sale a large amount of cigarettes have certainly impact on this problem. Therefore, they should pay the responsibilities to help government solve this problem, and protect their consumers health.In conclusion, although people should responsible for themselve health problem, that tobacco companies also should pay money for cancer patients, because they should pay responsibilities.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300473269	What is the trend of current world? Actually, to develop technology has become a priority for almost all countries. It was but hundred years ago, when the first computer wasn't painted, people's life was altered. In twenty first century, mobile phones with Internet came to our life. However, the discussion on whether smartphones are conductive to teenagers is a hot issue. Some people think phones should be given to people aged 8 to 12 because it is useful for communicating with families. While I believe that smart phones should be banned for young children who are 8 to 12 because of the disadvantages of social media and the lack of self-control.It is undeniable that cell phones could be the distraction for children's study. It's probably because young children do not have the ability to concentrate on what they are able to do. Instead, they are curious of cell phones with additional functions such as chatting software or Internet. In this way, their academic results may be affected. What is more, children are too young to manage their time well. For example, some of them are more likely to use their phones during the class, that will puzzled the teachers as well. Thus, the young age caused children to use phones incorrectly.Another point is that social media plays a major role in smart phones. This could affect children to access some trash information. For instance, there are many porns or violent videos attached in advertisements. Children during that age are prone to be attracted by those information, so that their mental health would not be protected. Moreover, they may tend to do some harmful things for society if they watched the anti-behavior related videos. For example, students are more likely to imitate the drunks to destroy the street. Therefore, mobiles phone could be harmful for those young people.Although some people may say phones could build connection between parents and children. In this way, their safety could be ensured somehow. However, to acquire the information about children's, there are many alternative ways, such as calling teachers, asking headmasters or consulting their classmates. Compared with the disadvantages of mobile phones, banning phones are possibly benefit for young children's health.In conclusion, the conductive as it is to communication, their shortage of phones other way the benefits for those aged 8 to 12. Maybe provide phones when they are older could be better for both children and family.	5	4	4	4	4	4
300476977	Recently, technology enables people to live conveniently and get a variety of benefits. Accordingly, more young people tend to use mobile phones compared to previous years. I strongly disagree this argument that the use of mobile phones for children between 8 and 12 years old because it is possible that the lack of communicate skill and face to face and it might lead to bullying.The first reason I want to be opposite position of the argument is that young people have a possibility to lose communicate with other people directly. For example, if young people usually use mobile phones such as iPhone and Android as a communication tool, they are able to contact to other people indirectly. It can indicate that young people might prefer online communication to direct communication. And they cannot communicate with other people in face to face very well.in addition, the use of mobile phones in young age (8 to 12 year old) can lead to bullying. In fact, bullying is one of the most serious issues in school. Moreover, one of the causes of this problem is mobile phones. Most of young people don't know how to use mobile phones well. And they tend to use in wrong way as bullying. It has a bad impact on children's growth and might result in suicide.however, some may agree that the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 aged children, claiming that it is an effective and convenient way to communicate with other people. In fact mobile phones have a plenty of benefits. But young people cannot use mobile phones very well because their brain is not growing enough. That is why disadvantage of the use of mobile phones outweighs the advantages.In conclusion, I prefer that young people should	4	4	4	4	4	4
300479609	With the development of information technology, people's life has been changed quickly. For the new generations, mobile phone has because done most frequently communication tools with their family and friends. However, some people argue that the use of mobile phones for 8-12 year old children may leads to some negative effects. Overall it is unreasonable.The first significant reason to support the use of mobile phone for teens is that this is an inevitable revolution for human being’s society. Furthermore, there many advantages in this case. For instance, teens could profit cell phone's convenience in order to improve their study performance. Especially for language learner, need dictionary may replace the traditional paper dictionary totally. Only few seconds, people will find out the word directly by search engine. By contrast, the traditional dictionary takes more time on searching process.Another reason to agree young people to maintain their mobile phones is that for the period age of 8-12 year old, security is one of the most concern for their parents. Their cell phones can give the guarantee of safe if the teens involved any incidents. Moreover, most of cell phones has GPS system nowadays. In the frequent earthquake areas, it is easier to locate people who need helps.Certainly, despite mobile phone brings many benefits for people, the negative effects still exist. For example, many children and teens overuse mobile technology and be toxided by cell phone. When they leave their phones, it occurs some negative effects such as anxiety or depress. additionally, some children stay at night in order to play cell phone games and affect their quality of sleep. Whereas, if people balance the advantages and disadvantages of mobile phone uses. It is easy to find out that the advantages of mobile phone uses outweigh the disadvantages because the above problems can be controlled with their growth.In conclusion, the development of technology can not be resisted. It might be a cliche that the technology development will modify people's life, particularly for the future generations. However, people ought to aware that they should intend to accept the new circumstances but not concentrate on their nice flash-back memories.	4	4	4	4	3	4
300484037	Do you agree that young children aged 8 to 12 can use electronic devices to communicate with people? Some people believe that children can use mobile phones aged 8 to 12, in order to keep in touch with other. However, some group disagree to let children age 8 to 12 to use electronic devices. In my opinion electronic devices has many benefits to people, including children, so children who are aged 8 to 12 can use mobile phones to communicate with their family and friends.Electronic devices, such as mobile phone, tablet and laptop have a great effect to the most of people including children. One of the benefits of using mobile phones is communicate with family and friends. For instance, from my own experience while I am studying in New Zealand I missed my family so much as well as my children missed their parents to; in this case, I always use my mobile phones to connect with my family in Saudi Arabia, in addition to that my children use phone to call their grandparent. Moreover, there are many application in mobile phones which allow you to make a call video, so my children can speak and watch their grandparent and family clearly; also, the cost of making coal is so cheap which depends on the Internet.Another advantage of using electronic devices, it has some applications that help children to learn languages in their home. For example, English cafe website, BBC learning English and many applications. I always encourage my children to use these websites, because it's free and helpfull. Learning becomes easily by using smartphone and other devices; in the past learning was difficult because if you or other children want to learn they should go to English Language instruction which coast a lot of many, also, you need to transport them to institution, now children can use smartphone anywhere and anytime to communicate or to learn.Some group believe that it's dangerous two children aged under 12 to use electronic devices, even though for communicating their family and friends. They claim that these devices might cause to children some problems, such as addiction, mental problem or wasting their time. However, children needs to use smart phone to communicate their grandparents and their friends especially they are abroad.In conclusion, the debate about young children aged under 12 who are using smartphones to communicate is ongoing and some people agree and insist to to give an opportunity to call and other disagree. In my opinion we should let our children to use these devices in appropriate way, also, te	4	4	4	3	4	4
300484657	Nowadays everyone has the right to use mobile phone for communication included the children. Because of keeping pace with technology and emergency situation, it is acceptable to allow two children to carry and use mobile phones anywhere.Specifically, this generation live in race with technology, everyday we have something new about technology to be aware about. It's common that the individual who has an advance knowledge about technology come over his/her peers. So it's a wise act to allow two children to use mobile phone not only that but engage them to use them professionally.In addition, many emergency situations required existing mobile phone. So carrying mobile phone for children is considered as necessary act because children as all people at the risk of unexpected accidents and it is possible to need to mobile phone to contact in emergency situation. However many parents use sharing location lively property with their children to watch them in addition to regular usage of mobile phone like voice call or text message or even social media apps.On the other hand, children are at great risk to be mobile phone addicts but if we look again to mobile phone addiction we absolutely find out that this problem is sprude for all ages, so I think that banning mobile phone for children escaping from the addiction problem is not effective solution.To sum up, children could use mobile phones in professional way if way encourage them to use smartphones for get full advantages of this developing technology	4	4	4	4	4	4
300486175	In the information driven ago, more and more children use cell phone to connect with their family and friends even if they are only age from 8 to 12. This is no wonder why there has a heated debate among educators and parents. Some people believe that the new technology bring in a plenty of benefits for children aged 8 to 12. However, I firmly hold an opposite opinion.First of all, children lack the ability to identify good or bad. In the meantime, there are many unhealthy and harmful information in the Internet. If things go on like this, children may regard those toxic information as truths, it will exert very negative impact to them. Last week, I received an information on WhatsApp, it said a huge earthquake will hit my hometown in few days. It is obviously a rumor, however, children may think it's true then be disturbed by the panic. We can conclude from this example that using mobile phones are not very suitable for children.What is more, children are not good at controlling themselves, they may be absorbed in the artificial world and it's really bad for their future development. According to a survey conducted by Zhejiang university, children who take delight in spending their time on smartphone always can't make a efficient communicate with their peers in a face to face situation. Moreover, too much phone time late children can't concentrate on study, which should come first to students. Furthermore if they behavior bad in school, they will lose confidence about realistic world and waste more time on staring in tiny screen, it's a bad reflection.Admittedly, since the advent of instant message, it becomes possible for people to communicate with each other anytime and anywhere. Nevertheless, even adults may be induced by smartphone. So provide mobile phones to children aged 8 to 12 notablely not a considerate idea. Parents should play an important role in monitoring the use of mobile phone of their young children.In summary, I disagree the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children cause it will influence children's concept and disturb their lives.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300436199	In nowadays, people pay more and more attention on health, as the life condition rises. Parents become nutrist almost, they could share articles about health in their social median frequently post op one important topic is about smoking that is harmful to the smokers and othe people around them. But some argue that smoking can be accepted. However, in my view, the source of smoking is cigarette, which should be restricted by paying large amounts of money as a smoking tax.The 1st and most important reason why should levy taxes is that it can reduce the number of cigarettes consumed by smokers. If the manufactures of cigarettes are required to pay more money, they would rise the price of cigarettes. Result, smokers only can buy list cigarettes with the same budget on smoking. Consequently, smokers consumed less cigarettes will face a smaller potential risk of developing cancer, especially the lung cancer.Another reason why government shout livy a higher tax on cigarettes manufactures is that gaining more money to invest on health care industry. There is a common knowledge that smoking is one of the key causes leading to lung cancer. Therefore, people and government spend a huge amount of money to treat lung cancer, but there are still millions of patients died every year. As a result, government need more money to support the promotion of the awareness the disadvantage of smoking, to build a more advanced health care system, especial for these undeveloped countries, such as in China that contributes approximately one third of the lung cancer population, While the overall chiness population is only 20% of the whole world's population.In contrast, some argue that there are many disadvantage of a higher tax on cigarette manufactures, like increasing the economic pressure to the smokers whose desire of smoking is very strong, reduction of the original cigarette price causing to the lower income for cigarettes farmers.In conclusion. It is necessary to pay more money.	2	4	4	4	4	4
300443203	The smoking causes are cancer which is so serious disease. The smoking cigarette has gained significant popularity in recent years. According to the same scientists, it is enormous impact on health problems, there is no doubt that. The smoking may reduce stress. However, it affects health issue and impacts on smoker’s budget. For those reasons, it is my opinion that companies should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people.One of the most significant reason is that the smoking cigarette creates health problems. People who has to be healthy for achieving their own goal. It is required to be great level of motivation. If smokers consume more cigarette, they can lose their learning capability to improve themselves.Another important reason is that smoking cigarette affects smokers income negatively. The cigarette is very expensive. Smokers can purchase beneficial materials which are books, home furniture or clothes instead of cigarette. Smokers have to identify this issue and avoid from cigarette. Some companies which manufacture cigarettes are not reliable. Their advertising and marketing strategies provides lack of information to impacts on smokers opinion efficiently. After that, smokers tend to consume more cigarette.conclusion, cigarette has many unbenefits. government should regulate this process. Manufacture companies should obey implement policy.	2	3	3	3	3	3
300446328	In recent years, a large number of people get lung cancer because of smoking. Some people believe that cigarette companies should pay money for those people who develop cancer from smoking. In my opinion, that's not cigarette companies business. Because they don't have responsibility for those kinds of people and this is people's own choice.Firstly, companies which manufacture cigarettes is a big business, they provide needs for consumer who wants cigarettes, but they don't have responsibility for those people who develop cancer from smoking. For instance, in this world, an increasing number of people are smoke. As we know, smoking can lead to lung cancer and other kinds of disease, smoker buy cigarettes from cigarettes manufacturer companies, so should these companies spend much money on people who get cancer. That is not their business. Definitely, they don't have responsibility for those people.Secondly, this is people's own choice. No one can make decision for them. Not only elder, many teenagers and adults tend to smoking in recent years. Some teenagers do not have good self-control, once they smoke, they are addicted. Adults can make their own decision, they choose to smoke, no one have responsibility to educate them. Elder are old generation, their family members just allow them to smoke. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for humans body, But still many people are smoking. On the other hand, cigarette companies sale cigarette. They are not wrong, but whether people will buy it, depends on ourself.Some people may say that if companies do not manufacture cigarettes, people will not smoke, and the number of people who smoke will reduce. But if a person have good self-control, whatever the company sale cigarette or not, they will do not buy it.In conclusion, smoking is people's own choice, we know that smoke a lot will develop cancer, so the best way to keep healthy is control yourself. Companies which manufacture cigarettes do not have responsibility to pay money for people who develop cancer from smoking, because this is people's own choice.	3	4	4	4	4	4
300400010	Nowadays, the number of people who develop cancer smoking increase significantly. Smoking is very dangerous and harmful for people and children. I believed that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay a lot of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. In my opinion, that is a good idea and the following argument will explain this view.first of all, smoking is a bad habit of almost men and some woman has the same situation. The consequence of smoking is the increase of people who are cancer. There are some companies which manufacture cigarettes pay large amounts of money to people who develop cancer from smoking will have more opportunities to prevent the cancer. For example, in Vietnam, a lot of men are cancer from smoking and they do not have money to prevent the cancer. Therefore, there are some companies inside and outside Vietnam support the financial for them to help people who are cancer may be better. In addition, these companies want to demonstrate the impacts of smoking.Moreover, the action of these companies will help people who develop cancer from smoking have more motivations to live continually, because they have supporting such as money from the companies which manufacture cigarettes. In other words, the cancer is frequently developing and it will become more dangerous day by day. Some people are cancer from smoking just wait for die because they do not have strong financial to prevent the developing of cancer. The supporting of these companies may help people who are cancer maintain their life.In conclusion, smoking is a bad habit and people should prevent doing it. The action of the companies is not only help people who are cancer from smoking have more opportunities come over the difficult situation, it also give them the motivation to maintain their life. Therefore, companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking.	3	4	3	3	3	3
300441214	Nowadays, an increasing number of people suffer from cigarettes and negative effect of second-hand smoking. It costs amounts of money to treat the people who get lung cancer from smoking. Some people think that cigarettes manufactory should pay more money to support cancer development, because it is these companies responsibility. In my opinion, it is a good idea to control the number of people who are involved in smoking, and it also can improve health level of people.On the one hand, this policy can reduce people's frequence of smoking, which lead to decrease negative impact on people's health. If cigarettes manufactories have to pay more money to governments, the cost of production will increase. It means cigarette price will arise, so apart of people could not afford it. Therefore the number of people who want to buy cigarettes will be declined. Those people who do not have enough money to buy cigarettes could reduce the frequence of smoking or even they will not smoke anymore. It is a good trend to keep people's health.On the other hand, if the organizations which are involved in cancer development could gain more fund to support their projects, the country's health level will has a great prograss. Governments use those money to build organization which improve people's life quality and enhance their health system. It is a great method to improve people's well-being.In conclusion, I think that it is a good method to solve the smoking problem, if governments can use those money efficiently and build better health system, it will be a significant prograss for their people's well-being.	3	4	4	4	4	4
300446492	Nowadays, it is common to see people have cancer such as lung cancer after smoking for a long time. For this reason, some people argue that the cigarettes manufacturing companies should pay compensation to those people. In my opinion, this is not a good idea because the main responsibility caused this problem are not from the cigarettes manufacturing companies, besides, the cigarettes manufacturing industry is also an important industry for one country.Firstly, their main responsibility for people who suffer for cancer after smoking are not due to cigaretter manufacturing companies, but themselves. Researchers found that when one person smoke for a very long period, their percentage of develop cancer will 70% higher than people who just smoke cigarettes for few years. Also, cigarettes are considered to be a good way to reduce stress for some persons. Therefore, appropriate smoking can be received, the main point is people how to control their times and numbers of smoking.Secondly, cigarettes manufacturing industry is an important industry for one country. For example in China, there are a large numbers of people who smoke cigarettes, so the income of cigarettes consumption make up about 30% of the whole income one year. Moreover, the government also developed the cigarettes industry development because cigarettes industry contribute to a large proportion for the economic income.However, it is true that the companies which manufacture cigarettes have an big influence on people smoking because if no companies product cigarettes, people will no smoking. However, the main responsibility for citizens smoking is the government should improve the citizens awareness of the healthy problems that can caused by smoking and people should control themselves. Therefore, the cigarettes manufacturing companies should not pay lare amounts of money to people who suffer for cancer due to smoking.In conclusion, the main reasons that people smoke a large numbers of cigarettes are not due to the cigarettes manufacturing companies, it is the people themself and the government should improve their awareness.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300451442	Recently, there are some studies which smoking increases that percentage of people who develop cancer. Because of this fact there is an idea that companies which produce cigarettes should pay a lot of money as compensation don't stop this is a is agree that idea and it shows two reasons. One is that this system can reduce the number of cigarettes companies and second reason is this system also can reduce the number of smoker.First, this paying system is good for reducing companies which manufacture cigarettes. If companies have to pay large amount of money, it is big damage for companies and their profit will become small. This is why, their positive effects which is produced from making cigarettes will reduce and the number of companies also will decrease year by year. In addition, if the companies related to cigarettes decrease, this system of paying money leads to the other companies which produce something causes the bad influence for people's health. Reducing these company, is good effects for people.Secondly, this system can decline the number of people who use cigarettes. Its companies which manufacture cigarettes must pay large amounts of money as compensation, the price of cigarettes will be expensive because the companies have to get more profit. That change makes harder to buy for people. In addition, smoking increase the rate of cancer for people. This is why, if the number of smoker decrease, the number of people who will face cancer problem also decrease.On the other hand, there is an opinion that companies should not pay money because they don't force people to use cigarettes. So, people who use cigarettes should pay more money. Of course, smoker should pay money more. However, if the number of companies which advertise smoking decline, that influence the increase of non-smokers because people will get opportunity for smoking less than before.In conclusion, this is a argues about two advantages of the system which companies related to smoking should pay more money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. If the system stops, it can reduce the number of companies related to smoking and smokers. This is why, it is agree the paying system.	4	4	4	4	3	4
300456377	The habit of smoking has been prevailed among young generation regardless of gender attributed 2 peer influence, stress and even the way of showing up themselves. This devastating habit leads to chronic diseases and indeed cancer. Some advocates of cigarettes argue that although smoking brings a health damage to them, it does not affect others. However various research on habitual smoking states that people who live and communicate with ones who are smoking amid even be likely to suffer from harmful health rather than smokers. Therefore cigarette companies should have responsibility for developing cancer caused all's smoking because such compensation might benefit both individuals and society as well.The first and foremost reason to support the idea that imposing high rate of taxation on cigarette manufacturers fund to cancer curement development is that it is likely to be beneficial to individuals particularly smokers and their families. If this such companies have to pay a huge amount of money did used from their revenues, they in turn need to rise their price of production. This lead to some cigarette users may be unable to affort mix regularly and reduce the smoking frequency. Moreover indirect smokers who are close to smokers and has severe effect of smoking, could be benefited when reducing the demand for cigarettes. list demand for it, which brings many advantages to smokers and indirect smokers.The second reason in support to fund the development of cancer treatment from cigarette income is that it benefits society as a whole. This means that the amount of income from cigarettes trade could primarily contribute to the cancer curing growth, which has high potential to encourage doctors and medical researchers find out knew treatment in order to cope with this did leading disease. To illustrate that the process of discovering new and effective treatment for treating cancer requires huge amount of money, devoted effort and time by thousand researchers and doctors, but it may not enough as only based on government spending, hence the money from cigarette revenues could contribute to big	4	5	5	5	5	5
300462744	It is quite common these days for people in many parts of the world to smoke. Smoking is harmful for our health, environment and society. If these companies of manufacturing cigarettes could pay huge amounts of money, it would reduce the number of cigarettes and increase the price of cigarettes. Therefore, from my perspective, although someone might think this is a bad idea, I still believe that the method can play a key role to reduce the amounts of smoker, so reduce and help the people who has cancer from smoking.There are strong grounds for believing that through the method that increasing the amounts of money which cigarettes companies should pay for can be a good idea. In the 1st place, if these companies pay for large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking, it would lead to huge losses so that these companies do not have enough money to produce more and more cigarettes, which could reduce the number of cigarettes, because which might reduce the number of smokers. Therefore reducing the rate of developing cancer from smoking. I think this is a good cycle to reduce the negative effects of smoking for our health, environment and society.Another reason for the method is that if these companies pay huge amounts of money for people who develop cancer from smoking, it would make these companies to raise the price of cigarettes stop the reason I have mentioned above, these companies want to resolution their losses so they would through the approach which increasing the price of cigarettes, which leads to more and more people can not afford the cigarettes. And then they might reduce the number of they smoke everyday so that reducing the negative effects of smoking for our life. Therefore, these factors can justify why I think the method is a good idea.However, someone think this is a bad idea because it is unfair for companies which manufacture cigarettes. These companies manage is do not teach people to smoke, do not make people to develop cancer, they only are businessmen as same as other companies, such as shoes companies. It is sure that they do not lead to other people ill, however, if our society do not have any companies which manufacture cigarettes, nobody wood smoking, so nobody will develop cancer from smoking. They have the responsibility to pay money for people who hurted by smoking.In conclusion, it is no doubt that the measure that requiring companies which manufacture cigarettes pay huge numbers of money as compensation to people who has cancer from smoking is a good idea. Because the method could lead to these companies 'cause huge losses, so they would reduce the number of cigarettes and increase the price of cigarettes, therefore, reducing the negative effects to our lives. I believe that, in the future, more and more people will like to quit smoking. Let's work together to creat a better life for ourselves.	4	5	4	4	4	4
300462939	Should cigarettes manufacturing company pay for cancer?The recent decades witnessed the development of cigarettes manufacturing industry. There are an increasing number of people are willing to choose to smoke too release their inner pressure but this result in many diseases such as lung cancer. Thus, many people argue that it is the duty for cigarettes manufacturing companies to pay for the people who develop cancer due to smoking. However, from my own perspective, these kind of companies shouldn't pay for it since it's consumers choice and hard to regulate.Most prominent reason for me to support my position that cigarettes companies don't have to pay for cancer is that smoking is the choice by consumers instead of the companies. To be more specific, the development of cigarettes is mainly because of the demand of customers. Nowadays, people smoke to reduce mental pressure. Without smoking, they may find another thing to replace it, and this can be even worse than smoking to our health. So in my opinion, the major reason of cancer due to smoking is not from cigarettes companies but individual choice.Hard to regulate is my second reason to support the opinion that cigarettes manufacturing companies don't have their responsibilities to pay for cancers. Because it is difficult to recognize the reason of the cancer, whether it is because of smoking? Which brand of cigarettes the patients use? And which cigarettes manufacturing company should pay for it? besides that, the compensation give opportunities to those who want to gain money from the companies so stop in a word, this kind of rule is hard to regulate and recognize.However, some people insist that if cigarettes companies can take charge of the compensation of cancer, it can control lung cancer Efficiently and it is the social responsibility for these corporation. I am convinced that instead of paying compensation, it is better to do something else such as advertising in the external of the cigarettes or educating youth to avoid smoking. In conclusion, on the one hand, smoking is the choice and need of the consumers so the companies shouldn't pay for it. On the other hand, it is hard to regulate and recognize the compensation. Thus, although many people support the rule, I will advocate very strongly it is not the duty for the cigarettes manufacturing companies.	5	5	5	5	5	5
300465371	Nowadays, there are many people smorke in the world and smorking is occurred cancer. Cancer is serious disease for us and if we become cancer, we will need a lot of money to cure cancer. This essay will argue that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking, because cigarettes are bad for health. In addition, companies have a lot of money.First, cigarettes aren't good for health, so companies don't think people health. Company did people feeling which want to smorke. If the companies don't make a cigaret, people will not smorke, so companies should pay for people who develop cancer.Second, companies have a lot of money. There are many person who is poor or rich. If we are rich, we will be able to pay money to cure cancer, but if we are poor, we will be not able to pay to cure cancer, so companies which manufacture cigarettes, but the companies don't have enough money, so money which is cigarettes should increase the cost, then the companies should collect money from each person who buy cigarettes till stop at last, the companies paid to people who develop cancer from smorking.On the other hand, smorking is responsible by each person, because if we don't smorke, we will be cancer from smorking, so many people think people who become cancer from smorking have to pay money to cure cancer by themselves, but if the people don't have enough money, the people will not be able to cure the cancer, so it is not and people don't want to die from cancer, so the company should help two people who develop cancer from smorking.In conclusion, the companies have to pay monies people who develop cancer from smorking, because the companies make dangerous cigarettes. People need many money to live healthy, so the companies have to pay two people who develop cancer from smoking.	3	3	3	3	3	3
300470886	Nowadays, there are a number of people who depend on cigarettes. Some people think, the cigarettes companies should pay a majority of money to people who develop cancer from smoking. It is a good idea? This is a I would argue about fast the companies pay money to people who get the cancer may let people could not relize the important of smoking is harmful for their body. In addition, more and more people would like to smoking, and the government should do something.Firstly, people could not relize smoking is really harmful for their body yes the manufacture cigarettes companies pay money to them when they develop cancer from smoking. For example, they would think that they should not pay their own money to their terrible body. Thus, they reduced their burden and more easily to smoke more and more cigarettes.Secondly, they are increasing all those people would like to try cigarettes as the companies pay money for them so stop although they are poor the government play a very important role to guide public try two band the cigarettes because the people who developed cancer from smoking can not have a beautiful life in the future.However, some people who develop cancer from smoking and they are really poor, the companies help them pay large amount of money can reduce their burden when they have not money to pay. Thus can save their lives. But it can improved more and more people have not limit to try cigarettes and cause their poor health.In conclusion, companies which manufacture cigarettes should not pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer or smoking because is would cause people could not relize on smoking is really harmful for their body. The government should guide people reduce the consumption of cigarettes and let people have a healthy life.	3	4	4	4	3	3
300474317	Companies which produce and sell cigarettes should not provide a huge amounts of money as compensation to those people who get cancer.First, I believe most of the people who buy cigarettes and smoke are not forced by anyone to do it. People who decide to smoke should be aware of cigarettes can harm their health. Companies should pay more attention and invest a large amounts of money on advertisements which can warn people that smoking is not beneficial for them.Furthermore, selling and providing cigarettes are these companies main income sources. They earn money from those who volunteer to buy cigarettes. Companies can choose if they want to pay money as compensation. For instances, smokers who had cancer save one cigarette of money a day, there will be a huge amounts of money that they can help themselves to fight the diseases. Moreover, if they save the money instead of smoke everyday, they may not get cancer, so they will not use the money as compensation.However, if companies pay money as compensation to people who suffer from cancer, they may can gain positive voices from their families, friends or even public. People may notice that these companies not only just sell cigarettes and get money from people but they also focus on the patients and take care of them. There are some people think that those big companies get money from the public, so they should give something back to the society. But they are all depends on the companies.In conclusion, cigarettes companies should not pay money as compensation to people who develop cancer. The majority of people already know that smoking do not include any advantage before they choose to smoke. They must take care of themselves and the companies should not pay any medical fee for them.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300467528	With the steady growth in the country's economy as well as the people's living standard an increasing number of people are likely to choice smoking as an interest to release pressure. Some people think that companies manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who suffer cancer from smoking. Although these method take attention to many people and give grant to those people. It caused more and more people negalate the dangers of cigarettes. Moreover, it caused the unfair of the society so stop it is my opinion that this is a bad idea.The main reason to support clain is that it cause a large amounts of people negalate the dangerous of smoking. Some people may think the money are important than health. With the development of the technology, that medicine developing fast. If put lots of money to those people who develop cancer they will think themself take advantage of this. They don't care about their health and by this way to get more money.The further reason to support claim is that the method caused the unfair of society. This is a bad behavior to smoking. Those people who choice bad behavior it develop cancer is them own choice. For many people they don't have money to pay for large medicine cost and even wait to die. For example, the two people stayed in the hospital, caused by cigarettes, the other is caused by car accident. The first patient is supported many money to take medicine so stop the other people growth in poor family, they don't have money to pay for the cost. It cause the unfair.Some people think it can show a good company, increasing the sense of belonging. It is true that company have responsible to do something to compensation people and maintain their service. Although it seems that reasonable and attractively, it cannot hold the water. The bad behaviour is the individuals choice. When companies put money into the society it cause many positive impacts and influence the social atmosphere. Let more people to have a bad idea to earn money.In conclusion, although it is benefit for companies to provide a good service, it cause people negalate their health and attractive more people to smoking. Moreover, it caused the unfair of the society. If use the suitable strategies by understand and manipulating relevant factors the problems could be fine and achieve the desired outcome.	4	3	3	4	3	3
300468373	Since cigarettes are widely spread all over the world and people can easily get them, many of the people could suffer from the harmful effect of the cigarettes. It might cost some time and money to cure those illnesses caused by the cigarettes; however, there should be some reasons that cigarette manufacturers do not need to take responsibility to pay the amount of money as compensation to the people.Initially, it is undoubtedly clear that consuming cigarettes is own responsibility as warning notice is shown on the package and on each box of cigarettes. Furthermore, there is the education of the harmfulness of cigarettes and drugs which strongly acknowledge that two of them are seriously dangerous in terms of the health of the human body. Therefore, the responsibility which people must have should not be compensated by the cigarette manufacturers.Another reason could be that the compensation possibly encourages higher number of smokers. For instance, if the people who developed cancer due to the cigarettes get compensation from the cigarette companies, other people who have not got cancer might think that they are also able to have compensation as they suffer from cancer. To inhibit this behaviour companies should not provide the idea that there is a possibility of getting money from this mindless action. Moreover, it is difficult to ensure that whether the cancer is surely caused by the cigarettes or not. Since it could possibly be unclear then no one can claim the particular companies are responsible for the consequences of smoking.On the other hand, some critics might claim that there would be some people who started smoking without the knowledge of how harmful the cigarettes are. In fact, there could be a difficulty of having enough education due to their financial problem and it leads to even bad behaviour. Nevertheless it shouldn't be the cigarettes companies responsibility but the government needs to support those victims of the cigarettes. For example, the government could provide a sort of free health care for the smokers suffering from cigarettes in particular so the whole country can tackle the problem and also reduce the particular number of smokers.To summarise, although cigarette manufacturers produced the cigarettes which potentially causes to develop cancer, the consumption of the cigarette totally depends on People's Choice. In addition, the cigarette manufacturers took responsibility which is to notice the harmfulness of it with pictures and warnings. The significant changes supposed not to be taken by the companies but be taken by people, especially smokers.	5	5	5	5	5	5
300470595	There are still amount of people smoke even if they know it is bad for their health. So there is a question: should companies which manufacture cigarettes pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking? I don't agree with this idea.Smoking or not, it is people zone decisiones. Not everyone chooses smoking and not everyone have cancer from smoking. There is a situation that whether you have cancer is not based on the time you smoke. Some people they smoke for a long time, they even do not have cancer even when they are old. But some people may develop cancer when they smoke not for a long time. So I think it depends on people's physical condience. so companies do not need to pay amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking.If people know the companies will pay large amount of money for people who develop cancer from smoking, so the people will not decrease smoking. So it is not a good way to avoid people smoking. As we know, there are many harmful things in one cigarette. We even do not have a deep understanding about these harmful things. So it is useless that people already have sick about smoking then companies have the action about it like pay money to people. It is important that people should have the mind to reduce smoking instead of spending much money after have cancer from smoking.There also have some benefits about companies which manufacture cigarettes pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. Do to peoples stress become more heavier than before, more and more people choose to smoke to avoid much pressure which in their work and families. If they smoke for a time, they cannot stop. So some people will have the heavy illness like cancer. It is a useful way to help these people to get much better. The government still should tell people the harm of smoking and make people know much about the cigarettes.Although companies which manufacture cigarettes pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking may help people out of the harm of cancer, there still not a good way to avoid people smoking too much. Government should have action to focus on the number of cigarettes which companies sell at day and people also should control the number of cigarettes they smoking a day.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300475607	Cigarettes are something which have high risks of cancer. Some people argued that the cigarettes companies should compensate large amounts of money to people who develop cancer because of smoking. It this essay, I will argue that why it is not a good idea.Firstly, smoking is an individual behaviour. That means it is actually people can avoid to smoke, so that they will not develop cancer. But many men like to snug as frequent as eating. If they smoke 3 * 1 day or a pack of cigarettes one week, it is a fact that they must have illness from smoking when they are old. Why the cigarettes companies must pay for these people who can not control themselves? Moreover, smoking is a good way to reduce stress for men if they know the risks of cigarettes.Secondly, it is hard to say that the cancer is caused by smoking. As we all know, cancer is 1 diseases that can not be cured, and there are many reasons for the cancer. It is a big problem to define the cancer is caused by cigarettes. if a person has a hobby too smoke and he developed cancer, but he also has other serious illness, how to make sure that the cancer is caused by smoking not other illness? So it is difficult to range what the companies should to compensate.It is true that cigarettes companies should tell public that risks of smoking. People have the rights to know why cigarettes is dangerous and they will have option to choose smoking. Therefore, many companies copy the symbol of dangerous smoking on the plastic pack. Even though they can highlight the risks, they can not prevent people to smoking more. Thus, the cigarettes companies have no responsibility to compensate people. Next line in conclusion, to some extent, it is not a good idea let companies to pay for someone develop cancer from smoking. The risks of cigarettes should be taken by smokers, and the companies only have the responsibility to tell public the risks.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300475609	In recent years, a large number of people have developed cancer because of smoking. Those people need to pay much money for treatment. So some people argue that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. However, other people think this idea is not useful to decrease the number of smoking people and companies have no responsibility to do this. For those reasons, I believe that is not a good idea.The 1st and most important reason to support my view that companies pay money to people who get cancer is not a good idea is useless in decreasing the number of smoking people. Nowadays, some people give up smoking because they are afraid of developing cancer and their families cannot afford treatment. Have companies spend money on treatment to them, those people may have a view that anyway, they do not have to pay much money for medical services. So the number of smoking people has no possibility to decrease, even increase.The second reason to support my view is companies have no responsibility to pay large amounts of money as compensation to people. No one has no idea that smoking is bad for their health. And there is a sign ‘smoking is bad for your health’ on the cigarettes boxes. However, people still choose to smoke, although they know it is bad for their health. So when they develop cancer from smoking, they should take responsibility for themselves. It is not fair for companies to take responsibility.Those who think that companies should pay money to people to get treatment point two teenagers. It is true that many teenagers get cancer because of smoking and the companies attract. However, parents should be responsibility to their children. Teenagers who get good car and well educated have no possibility to show increase in smoking. And what the companies should do, they may should ask shops not to sell cigarettes to young people.In conclusion, companies pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking is not a good idea. Because it is not useful to decrease the number of smoking people and companies have no responsibility to do so. In the future, it will be more effective if people can control themselves far away from smoking.	4	5	5	4	4	4
300476894	In the contemporary world, manufacturing the cigarettes are very profitable and I growing number companies start to manufacture cigarettes in order to earn more money. Under circumstance, people have a discussion whether companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay a lot of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking or not. Some people consider that companies which makes cigarettes should pay lots of money for people. But, other people hold the opinion that people who like to smoke never care about their health, so it is unnecessary to pay money for those people. In my opinion, companies which manufacture cigarettes should be responsible to pay large amounts of money for people suffering from cancer.There are some evidences to show that it is necessary to pay money for people from cancer although many people disagree my opinion. The first of all, many people suffer from cancer due to fact that they smoke too many cigarettes, these cigarettes are manufactured by these companies. If these companies stop or reduce the amounts of cigarettes produced, the rights of people suffering from cancer will decrease. What is more, the leaders from companies never care about people's health and produce a large amounts of cigarette for their own profit. Therefore, these leaders should pay money as compensation to those patients. Finally, those cigarettes advertisements have a bad example two teenagers. Many teenagers see some adults smoke in the public areas boy television and think they are cool, so they also start to knew the cigarettes by some cigarettes advertisement, And then try to smoke, so these cigarettes advertisements which created by companies has a negative effect on teenagers.It is not denied that some people who develop cancer from other vectors and many people who like to smoke still can live for a long time, but it is a reason why people can ignore the harm of cigarettes. Too many people suffer from cancer even die due to the cigarettes. Smoking not only be harmful for own health but also impart on others. They still manufacturers although companies know these. Therefore, they have responsibility of those people who develop cancer and should pay money as compensation to people.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300479587	Nowadays, it is common to see more and more people smoke during their daily life. Furthermore, it also results in serious consequences. Majority of people develop cancer from smoking. It is argued that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. In my opinion, I think it is a good idea because of responsibility and penalty.The first and most important reason that companies should pay large amounts of money to people who develop cancer from smoking is that it is their responsibility. It is the company which manufactured cigarettes provide the opportunities to people to smoke. Cigarettes not only harm the health of people who smoke, they also influence the health of other people he breathed the smoke. Numerous people who developed the cancer from smoking. The main reason is that companies manufacture cigarettes to the public. Therefore, it is their responsibility to pay for their money to people who develop cancer from smoking.Another reason to support that companies should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people is that it can be the punishment and penalty two companies. Recent years, the death rate of lung cancel increased graduately. it is because most people are addicted to the cigarettes. More and more people argue that the government should ban the manufacture of the cigarettes. If the companies pay large amounts of money to people who develop cancer from smoking, they would realise the serious influence of smoking and feel guilty for manufacturing the cigarettes. From this point of view, it is a good idea to punish and penalise companies that they should pay large amounts of money to people.It is claimed by some people that companies which manufacture cigarettes just provide a method for people to relax. They should not pay money to people. However, it is a short view that does take into account of the health of people. Even if a small number of cigarettes can also influence people's health as well as other people who do not smoke cigarettes.In conclusion, companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking in terms of that it is their responsibility and it is for their penalty. People also should take care of their health. In the future, it is suggested that there will be no cigarettes in the world.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300485726	Companies which manufacture cigarettes are earning a lot of money through this business. The substance of cigarettes is causing health issues to people. Therefore, these companies should pay large amounts of money to people who using cigarettes.In the last century the number of cigarettes companies got increased and they tried to produce a large number of cigarettes to get huge profit. In the beginning of the last century there were five managers of cigarettes companies in the United States of America who said that the cigarettes and its substances wouldn't affect negatively the health of people. Whereas what we can see it now is totally different.The reason that the cigarettes companies should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer because they are the main reason of producing cigarettes which effect negatively the health of people the substances of cigarettes cause cancer issues to people and it costs the government a lot of money to pay for this issue and they should provide professional doctors to take care of people.Some people say this issue belongs to people who using cigarettes and this is the consumer choice. However these companies should stop selling cigarettes from the government. Overall the cigarettes companies are taking the money of people through selling cigarettes which cause a huge health issues to people's health.I agree with this idea and I'm optimism about what are happening now which we can see some advertisements which supported by doctors and the Ministry of Health which give people awareness about smoking and how much it danger to their health.I learned from the past that we shouldn't trust the cigarettes companies.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300485728	Cigarette is one of the common thing that people are addicted. It is illegal drug almost in all countries in our globe. There are still unclear debates related to cigarette and people's health. One of the debate is that companies which manufacture cigarette should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. This essay will argue that they should not pay large amounts of money by providing reason which support this claim.Firstly, companies which manufacture cigarettes should not pay large because they are profit making companies. Their company is established to make a profit by selling cigarettes which they produced. In fact, they might have to inform that the cigarettes they producing have a negative impact on the customer's health, but they are not responsible for the impact that would happen to the people after they inform.Secondly, in addition to the first crime there is also another reason why cigarettes companies should not pay a large amounts of money as compensation to people who developed cancer from smoking. Government should subsidies for the people. This is because countries such as New Zealand are putting a large amount of taxation in companies which manufacture cigarettes. Therefore government is getting high tax income from them related to other sector, which makes the government potential strong to support people who suffer from cancer. In addition to this government have a separate health group who are responsible for this.Some people claim that people who do not smoke I'm more affected than people who smoke cigarette, so companies should pay large amounts of money. It is true that people who do not smoke cigarette I'm more affected than people who do, because people who smoking have a philtre which helps too philtre are the smoke, but people who are not smoking do not have that; however, there is also the responsibility of the government to band smoking in public areas, for example bus stations, parks and other areas and most Europe countries and USA are using this rule to mitigate the problem.In conclusion, when we see the impact of cigarette in people life, it is not only health problem there are also another such as economic and social impact. Government should work with other companies who related to this to address the problems effectively.	5	4	5	5	5	5
300055462	The companies which manufacture cigarettes possibly should pay the money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. Firstly because they are ignoring the lower of wisdom and health safety, and choose what is wrong and harmful to others.Secondly the deliberate ignorance, disrespect, disobedience, and failure to observe the law and practiece actively which causing harm to people is crime.But not more than 50% money towards to compensation to the medical treatment, lost of family member, or valuable crew member of the company, to this person, who developed cancer because of smoking should be aply. As another 50% will be on the person, who freely chose to have smoking, and life with cigarettes.Yes this is good idea because this is right and just, also help see the problem from another angle. To those who was blind why it is good idea? Simply because one law for all, and choose what is right is greatly important.As our supporting argument examples. The life of the people and their health and well being more important than profit, money. People who develop cancer often become disabled to work, families can loose their family members, workforce and the country can lost their valuable educated, skilled, and professional people.	3	3	2	4	3	3
300400011	nowadays, people live in modern life with enhanced facilities and high standard of demands. People usually use products which help them satisfy and cigarettes might be a necessary product which most of men smoke. They who believe that manufacture cigarettes should invest amount of money in compensation which prevent cancer from smoking. In my view, companies should practise this strategy to help consumers who develop cancer and people who beside them such as children.The most significant reason why companies should make actions is preventing cancer for consumers. Following that statistics, a large number of people who had cancer is remarkable increase. Everyday, people use too much with a huge of cigarettes which effect to their lung or breath and many kinds of body.If companies create competition, a number of consumers can limit. For example, many companies regulate a strategy which is informational marketing. That is showed a scaried pictures on the cover of cigarettes box which described a person use cigarettes with transformed body.Another reason is concerned about the health which is children. They are also a important factor which society should remind. Although, children do not consume cigarettes, they are also affected from this. Most importantly, children have health which is not strong like adult. So, the harmful smoking from using cigarettes would destroy children's body quickly.Some people think manufacture cigarettes make a compensation which lead to less profit. It is true that the number of customers would be decreased. However, companies are sustainable growth, because it is so difficult to stop smoking when smokers use cigarettes like a habit. In order to maintaining revenue, companies could boost the price of products, not only grow economy, but also decreasing cancer problems.In conclusion, it is significant to strategy when companies decide pay large amounts of money as compensation. Customers will be convinced from compensation and limit the number of cigarettes. Not only preventing cancer problems from adult, but also Children's Health.	3	3	3	4	3	3
300435089	Companies have existed for long time and it contribute a large amount of text for the national revenue which provide a huge disposable financial supporting to the public. Even though it had some negative impacts on people's health. It is claimed that those companies do not have responsibility to help people and I will argue that it might lead to more terrible consequences such as destroy the company's income and boost the number of smokers.Firstly, cigarettes companies have no responsibility to pay the massive money as compensation on the awful things by individual did because smoking is a personal choice. For instance, if people buy a new bike he broken his leg by himself. There is no one that will take the responsibility by personal actions. It is crucial to maintain the companies benefits.Secondly, the compensation of smoking will increase the number of people to smoke. There are considerable population who were already smoking for decades and the compensation would be an insurance for them. As a result, those funding promote smokers to keep doing that. What's more, it is important that the potential smokers will perceive which is a chance to start smoking.However, under the moral of influence, companies should spend some money to save people's life because, one way and others, it was results in companies saleing cigarettes. It is noticeable that the social contribution of companies may enhance their reputation. In addition, this circumstance will effects the people's life outlook or value outlook in order to misleading of orientation of the life therefore, there is no obligations that companies should help people.In conclusion, those manufactories will pay more tax to the government revenue too instead of setting compensation of smoking. It is a great way to rescue people from related to smoking diseases. More and more people will receive the right information of cigarettes companies.	4	3	4	4	4	4
300438545	Smoking become increasingly common between people there are many reasons why they choose it to do so. People know that cigarettes is very harmful to their bodies. And this is a I will argue that manufacturer cigarettes should pay to people who develop cancer from smoking a large amounts of money. The reason for that is smokers become addictions so they might obtain diseases. In addition, manufacture cigarettes could reduce of producing cigarettes because they are unable to cover the cost from big fine.Firstly, smoking is very harmful to our bodies and we could gain diseases like cancer. People who develop cancer work so hard in discover the cure from cancer by doing lots of experiments. It's very hard to make people quit smoking even if we do advertising because these people become addicted.Secondly, people who develop cancer unable to cover stuff large amounts of money by doing experiment to discover the cure for cancer from smoking stop the government should find companies which manufacture cigarettes and give these money to developer cancer. This work is very hard and require lots of experiment. So then the scientists in developing cancer be able to cover the cost and find the cure.Some people argue that manufacture cigarettes don't have to pay money because it's their profits and they don't have to pay large amount of money to scientist to discover the cure because they don't make people buy it forcely it's their choose. But cigarettes is harmful for people. The government should attempt to ban it and make people ban it in different way like allow people use electronic cigarettes rather than cigarettes which is very harmful for environment as well and we should do lots of advertising to wake these people.In conclusion, smoking is very bad and manufacture cigarettes should take this responsibility for these people who got cancer and	3	4	4	4	3	4
300446586	In some countries, cigarette companies have to pay the remedy expenditures of the smokers disease, such as the lung cancer. Some people believe that companies have to continue this approach because they have to accept the responsibility of the negative impacts of their products. While others argue that the cigarette companies have many financial benefits for the society. I personally agree with the former idea, because the drawbacks of cigarette companies outweigh their financial benefits. In this essay I will argue two main reasons as the evident.First and more important reason is the role of cigarette companies in the society. If they accept to pay for disease caused by cigarette, people will be awared after negative impacts of consuming such useless stuffs. For example, psychologists studies showed that these kind of compensations are likely a serious punishments for companies and individuals who have used to smoke about the consequences of their acts. However, some economists claim that such investments in cigarette and tobacco companies have more financial benefits than negative impacts. For instance, most of the cigarette firms in the USA have foreign investors from other countries like Israel or Cuba.The second core reason that I personally believe it completely, is the role of prevention in such issues. According to the health care experts, the convention is more efficient than the cure. Such compensation payments by cigarette companies are like negative advertisement against him. Moreover, I think that the government is paying the smokers illness before they get such a serious cancers like lung cancer. And the government pay for them from the tax payment resource is. In other words all the people in the society are paying for smokers remedies.To conclude, I think that sitting more strict rules for the tobacco industry can affect the individuals and the society's well-being in a positive way.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300446933	Recently years, many countries are making some policy to limit smoking because the government want to build a healthy and sustainable society. For example, NZ, the government order the companies pay a high fee for the cigarette and this let the price of cigarettes risen too. I will agree that cigarettes should pay large amounts of money to let people gradually away from the smoking because it is bad for humans body and also can cause the air pollution, pay extra money is useful.Firstly, smoking is bad for our bodies and environment. As we all know, smoking is one of the causes about people develop cancer toxic factors to let our lung be bad. Some people think know every smoker death from the cancer so smoking would not be the trigger of cancer. It is not true. Smoking is actually breaking out our bodies, also, it is the main cause of air pollution. As a surely, global warming is actually caused the temperature of the world increased about zero point 8 degrees C during a decade. We need to aware of this time to be sustainable. This is very important for the next generation. For our bodies and future, we need to get away from cigarettes.Secondly, pay a extra money can be control smoking it is easy to understand, cigarettes are the daily item cigarettes are increased, some people might be will try to give up because they do have enough money to pay for their smoking. Of course, less consumers is not a thing that the company want to see. So the government have to make some policy and let companies pay more fee. In this way, they will have to rise the value of cigarettes.It is true that cigarettes are useful to let people relax, if not they would not pay a lot of money to do something which bad for their life, some people even have an addiction on smoking. However, it still is disadvantages I to the advantages folks stop may be we can try to find other healthy way to relax ourself.In conclusion, I think companies which manufacture cigarettes should rise the price of cigarettes, in this way, we can slightly far away the disadvantages of smoking.	2	3	3	3	3	3
300446950	Nowadays, we live in an era of globalisation development, with the globalisation business development, tobacco, wine and coffee were the most popular products in the world. Especially tobacco, there are a lot of people smoking in different countries and smoking is beat for their healthy and other peoples healthy. This is a will argue that companies which manufacture cigarettes should not pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking because produce cigarettes is business way for those companies and people who buy the cigarettes is their choice.Firstly, produce cigarettes is a business way for those companies. As we all know, there are a lot of ways of earn money in the world, and produce cigarettes is just one of them. For example, some companies produce wine, some companies produce beer, those products also made a large number of people ill or feeling bed. Cigarette companies just use their own way to earn money and it is not illego about sail cigarette so they couldn't pay any money for some group, expect government.Secondly, people who buy the cigarette is their own choice. It is obvious that everybody know smoking is bed for our healthy and other people's healthy. People buy the cigarette because they want to smoking, it is not about cigarette companies. They didn't responsible for those people because they didn't tell those people and made them smoking and it is important, if we buy the cigarette, we always see “smoking is bed for your healthy.” A lot of people see that so they known the negative of smoking but they bought it.However, some people think cigarettes companies should responsible for the society and other people who didn't smoking because their products is not just bed for smoker, it is also bed for other people. But as I no, in China, all of the cigarette companies pay more money to the government than other companies and the government used those money to developing our health protact, so actually, those cigarette companies responsible own society.In conclusion, this essay argued that companies which manufacture cigarettes should not pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who developed cancer from smoking because produce cigarettes is a normal way to earn money.	3	3	4	3	3	3
300453068	As we all known that cigarettes as popular products have been selling for many decades, the large number of cigarettes are consuming every year even though it is not beneficial to our health. Some people said that cigarette companies need to afford the therapy fee of cancer patient. However it is argue that cigarette companies do not have the responsibilities of people's healthy conditions. From my point of view, cigarette companies should not pay money to people who have smoking related cancer because smoking is personal choice, and people should pay for their own behaviours.First of all, it is unfair for cigarette manufacturer companies to pay for cancer therapy. To be specific, legal smoking age is 18 years old, so all of smokers should be adults and they have cognitive capabilities to distinguish appropriate and inappropriate behaviours, if they choose to smoke they should responsible for themselves health. So, it is their own duty to pay for cancer therapy when they get smoking related illness such as lung cancer. Thus, it is unreasonable to require others pay for personal choice.Secondly, companies may have difficulties on finance because of the large amounts of compensation. For example, if cigarette companies gave a large amount of money to every cancer patients they may have not profits on their business, so that nobody wants to operate cigarette companies. As a result, the economy of countries will be reduced because of the downward situation and cigarette industries.On the other hand, some people may argue that the increasing number of cancer patients is the result of cigarette manufacture, so they should pay for those patients because they gained profits from selling cigarettes. It is true that those companies are getting many profits from smokers, however, the government also levy from cigarette companies profits, which means it is supported by the government, and the compensation not only companies but also government responsibility.In summary, it is unreasonable for cigarette companies to pay cancer therapy for smokers because smoking is personal choice. Besides, the compensation is not beneficial to countries economic development. So, people should responsible for their own choice.	4	5	5	5	4	5
300455780	Some people argue that cigarettes firms should pay a large number of money as compensation to individuals who develop cancer from smoking faced with this situation. I strongly agree with this idea as it may cause positive effects and motivating people to develop cancer, and promoting physical health. This essay will illustrate why.One reason is that people who develop cancer from smoking are more likely to be motivated by compensation from cigarettes companies. For instance, if firms give large amounts of money to individuals or agencies, they will have adequate finance and money to buy new equipment to develop cancer from smoking. In addition, this behaviour provides people with more opportunities to earn a satisfactory salary, and trigger more passion in the work. Therefore, cigarettes firms should pay compensation to people, and it may cause positive effects in motivating people who develop cancer from smoking.Another reason is that this behaviour is easier for people to reject smoking or not be addicted to smoke. As a result of companies which manufacture cigarettes pay a large number of money as compensation. The cost of cigarettes will much higher then before, and the retail price will increasing and extremely expensive all the time. Thus, it is unaffordable for younger people or someone who is not rich. Moreover, although individuals have ability to buy cigarettes, they will control and regulate the amounts of cigarettes in daily life as well. Therefore, this behaviour are more likely to help people reject smoking and improve the physical health.Some opponents argue that it may cause a negative impact on the benefits of companies which manufactured cigarettes. The cost will successively increasing due to the fact that companies pay compensation to people, and it poses a threat to the benefits of firms. For instance, firms will have a burden shortage or pay the salary to staffs lower and lower. However government and management policy can give compensation to help them. It is easier for firms to alleviate the stress of benefits.In conclusion, companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. In the future, the number of people who smoke frequently will decrease.	4	4	5	5	4	4
300458321	Nowadays, more and more people choose smoking to get relax. Smoker has become a huge part of world population. Meanwhile, lots of people get cancer because of smoke. Some people think the cigarette companies should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking, but some people don't agree with it. This essay will argue that these companies should pay money for these people because they get huge profit from smoker and it is a kind of responsibility.The most significant reason is that the companies which manufacture cigarettes get large amounts of money from the people who smoking. They need to do something not just take money in their profit because smoker will reduce if more people dead because of cancer. meanwhile, these companies pay money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking can give smokers strong confidence and let them do not worried about cancer. Therefore, cigarette companies pay money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking is good for their social role.Secondly, it is a kind of responsibility if these companies pay money to these people because these people develop cancer through their products. Most people will think a lot when they smoking, and the smokers will be reduced if these companies do nothing about this issue. Therefore, companies such manufactured cigarettes should pay more attention on these people who develop cancer from smoking.In contrast, some people think these companies shouldn't pay money for these people because the government and hospital should in charge about these issue. It is true that we cannot check that these people will get cancer only because of smoking. However, these companies be a part of our society and they should be responsible.In conclusion, companies which produce cigarettes pay money to these people not only good for their social role, it is also have a notable benefits for their business in the future. In this way, these companies will be more stronger.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300465369	Nowadays, it is easy to buy cigarettes and there are many kinds of cigarettes such as electric cigarettes, sweety smell cigarettes. There is a often debate about companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking or not. This is able argue that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amount of money because cancer may lead to death and high compensation fee may cause decrease cigarettes manufacture companies.The first reason to support this argue is that, cancer may lead to death. In fact, cancer is the one of disease that difficult to cure. If cancer be founded later stage, cancer move to another place and it will be impossible to cure. Thus, cigarettes manufacture companies should pay large amount of money as compensation.The second reason to support this argument is expensive compensation fee make decrease of companies which manufacture cigarettes. If there is no company of manufactured cigarettes people will give up to buy cigarettes and no one struggle from cancer because of cigarettes. For good health to people paying large amount of money is good way.On other hand, some people argue that the cancer because of cigarettes is responsible for the people who bought cigarettes. However, if no one make cigarettes and no one sell cigarettes, everyone can live without of worry from cancer because of cigarettes.in conclusion, cigarettes cause cancer and it is possible to kill the people. Thus, need to decrease companies which manufacture cigarettes. Then, the most effective way to decrease companies is companies which manufacture cigarettes pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking.	4	4	4	4	3	4
300474288	The use of mobile phones have a big impact on people from very early age. Especially in people from 8 to 12 the are rizons why some parents give to their chiid mobile phone for example to communicate with their famiy howerer in my opinion the use of mobile phones should be over 12 years old.The first reason to support my opinion is that chiid from 8 to 12 tend to spend a lot time playing on their phones and they not spend enough time in their study so their study mark may be low because they are distrated by the mobile phonesThe second reason is that chiid between 8 to 12 they haven't enougn knowledge to do good manages in their mobile phone for example sometimes their can login on pages where other people can send then violent games so their mind can lead to bad people and bad thinking and also the verbal communication with the people who are around them may decreased because they might no want to spend their time talking while they can be doing forever they want online.The age to use mobile phones should be over 12 because the person should be aware of the responsability of using it some people believe that they should give to their chiid mobile phone to communicate with their friends. but, about 50 years ago where there where no quanty of availabity of mobile phone people use others method to communicate with their friends and family with out many problems such as writing a latter.In conclution: the used of mobile phones is good for people who can do a good use I know that today day mobile phones a part of our daily life such as in our work to communicate with people but we maight think about the right age to give mobile phone to our chiid and for the new generation we should teach them that the verbal communication to other people face to face is more important than loss our time playing games in our mobile phones.	3	3	3	3	3	3
300476203	In today's world of advanced technology, children aged 8 to 12 have become more and more reliant on using mobile phones. Some people believe that mobile phones deprive time to study from children and mobile phones can be harm for children aged 8 to 12. However, In my opinion, children aged 8 to 12 have positive effect on using mobile phones.First, children aged 8 to 12 may gain useful information from mobile phones. For example, in older to finish homework, children may gain useful information about homework from mobile phones. In other words, children gain many interesting or informative knowledge with mobile phones. Compared to using dictionary, mobile phones provide children with useful information easily.Second, mobile phones help to reducing children stress. For example, mobile phones have many entertayment things such as movie, book or game. In addition, mobile phones provide many free app for children. Therefore, it is suggest that children gain fullfill or happiness by mobile phones. Mobile phones in rich children's life.However, some people suggest that it is not necessary for children to use mobile phones. This is because, mobile phones deprive time of sleeping. For example, if children use mobile phones before go to bed, children may not sleep easily. In other words, Mobile phones have a weaknesses points for children health. In addition, some people argue that mobile phones deprive time of studying from children. For example, if children dependent on using mobile phones, it would be difficult for children to concentrate on study. However, if parents manage to childrens schedule of use mobile phones or manage the time of study, the problem of using mobile phones may be resolved.In conclusion, the rate of using mobile phones by children will continue to increase. However, due to advanced technology, mobile phones provide benefit for children. Therefore, it is suggest that people may have to agree with the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children.	2	4	3	3	3	3
300478184	People nowadays around the world have mobile phones to communicate with friends, family or people who use social networking services, and to enjoy their private lives playing games or watching videos. The more mobile phones are evolved and developed, the wider the users of ages get. The mobile phone can make people's life more fulfilling with its functions and connect people around the world while it also has unfavorable aspects. However, I think children aged 8 to 12 should not use mobile phones for society and their health.The first reason for support my idea is that there are various kinds of online crimes and they are becoming more seriously and invisibly. Adult users have knowledge how to prevent their mobile phones from crimes and how to deal with it, however, young childlen don't have the knowledge and they use mobile phones with their curious heart. The targets that online criminals aim are mostly elderly people or younger childlen who don't know about dangerousness of using mobile phones. These days to security functions to protect these people are created, but parents cannot check and monitor their childlen what they are using every time.The second reason is that light from mobile phone disturbed the growth of young children who don't grow up well. For example, blue light of mobile phone affects the eyesight of good development. The time that childlen use the mobile phones get longer unless parents control the time. Larger numbers of childlen may not become adult with health body.Anti-scientists says mobile phones lit younger childlen to communicate with their family whatever happens such as natural disasters. Parents can check where their childlen are or keep in touch with them every time. However, the mobile phone has the limit to use because it needs energy charge. Younger childlen don't have to use mobile phones.In conclusion, mobile phone has some bad effect for young childlen in terms of social and health. Another function to communicate with their parents should be created in the future.	3	4	4	3	3	3
300478187	These days, not only adults but also children have mobile phones. Also, younger age such as 8 to 12 year old begin to have mobile phones due to communicate with their family and friends. There are positive and negative points to have them. In my opinion, I agree with using of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children. There are two reasons. Firstly, it is safety for children and their family. Secondly they can learn about risks of the use of mobile phones.The first reason to support my opinion is that using mobile phone provides safety to children in their family. By communicating with their family, families can know where children are. Also, if they can not communicate with their children, most of mobile phones have GPS, so their family can know the location of children then they feel safety.The second reason to support my opinion is that children can study about risks of using mobile phones. It is a important step to use mobile phones adequately in adult. Most of eight to 12 year old children spend a lot of time with their family. In other words, their family can take care of them closely. Therefore, if children face risks or problems with friends or someone by mobile phones, their family can teach risks to their children and children can have skills not to face problems again.Some people say that the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 years old children have bad impacts on their study skills and morals because mobile phones have some fun applications. It is true that some application lead to bad influences for children. However, their family who are worry about their children can change settings of their children's mobile phones. In addition, recently, some mobile phone companies provide new phones for children. Their products have alarm not to use for a long time and their family can get some information about how long their children use mobile phones. Therefore, their family do not need to be worry about their children’s bad influences.In conclusion, the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 year old children have good points. The first point is that mobile phones provide safety to children and their family. The second point is that children can study risks from their family before they head mobile phone and adults. In the future, more and more young children will have mobile phones and It is a necessary tool to communicate with their family and friends.	3	3	4	3	3	3

Mobile phones are one of the creations of technology therefore through the time it has advanced constantly. As a result children are fascinating because of the new advanced. Some adults opinions is that mobile phones may be banned two children aged 8 to 12. Faithful from other points of view children should be communicate with their parents through mobile phones. Nonetheless this essay will argue that mobile phones may disrupt children learning and the can be at online risk.The first idea to support the statement is that mobile phone may disrupt children learning. Mobile phones provide differents way to have fun as an example games and social media, apps. While a child are using mobile can be concentrate having fun as a result they maybe avoid their studies. It can be suggest that children may bring their mobile phone to school because of this teachers may have problem while they are teaching for the lack of children attention. Nevertheless Mobile phones can have a negative impact in children learning and it can be challenge to teacher maintain their attention.Children can be at Online risk while they are using mobile phones. Today children can be connected to the internet more compared with years ago because of the new advanced of the technology. This can be a way to children be it Online risk so many places such as colleges, universities, supermarkets between others provide WiFi to usuers. As a result children can take approach of this advantages to be connected taking them on risk of abuse through the internent. Some parents may experience some issues related with the internet as an example bulling, that is caused through the Iinternet four people.Some people believe that children may be communicate with their families through mobile phones. A significant amount of people are agree with the participation of mobile phones in children life because this is a way to children be communicate with their parents. Also mobile phones are part of the society in this days. However People may not aware of the issues that can be caused from mobile phones. As a result they may provide mobile phones to their childs thinking and security but putting them at risk.In conclusion mobile phones can be a way to stop children age 8 to 12 learning. Mobile phones may bring more problems to families and solutions so for this reason parents could stop giving mobile phones to children in this age. Other way to be communicate can be email and parents may monitore the children easier being in a computer than mobile phones=============================	3	3	3	4	3	3

This not only is there duty to do that, but also this behavior may increase the price of cigarettes that some people cannot afford that.firstly, the reason that cigarette companies should pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking is society duty. Whether the companies who are, it is their duty to something helpful to our society. by doing that, on the one hand, the companies will have a good impression from people’s view. a number of people might think the company like this has a strong responsibility to society. this is a good phenomenon for companies to sell their production. Then they could get a high profit than post. This will not only show a friendly impression to society and people, but also will increase companies income.Secondly, companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. As a result, this policy may leads to cigarette companies rise the price of tobacco. Because if companies support the people who have cancer caused by tobacco, they should pay a large number of money. It is difficult for companies to lose their profit, they would increase the price of cigarettes to earn more money to afford the payment for people who developed cancer from smoking. This might cause a problem, maybe some teenagers do not have enough money to buy tobacco. It might be a positive phenomenon about avoid smoking in our lives. Then it can bring more benefits to our society.It is said companies which manufacture cigarettes should not pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. This should not be a Imposing things for tobacco companies to do. The people who smoking are their options and attitudes. Government and companies should not pay for that. However, if companies pay for the money to cancer People who have by cigarettes. This could build up a atmosphere shows that cigarettes companies would like to help the illness. It is a good attitude two shows responsibility from cigarettes companies. After that, they may change some people's attitude to cigarettes and cigarette companies.In conclusion, this essay has argued that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation two people who develop cancer from smoking. From one aspect, these are cigarette companies duties to do that. Every companies should be responsible to society. Secondly, paying for money for people who develop cancer from smoking may provides more benefits to tobacco companies. It is predicted if cigarette companies continue to do that, our society will be more friendly, smoking will be less in the next decades.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300451427	Smoking has been recognized as a potential threat for people over decades. It is suggested that companies which manufacture cigarettes should give some compensation to those people who suffer from cancer because of smoking. In my view, companies which generate cigarettes should contribute amounts of profits to a charity which can help people who have cancer from smoking due to the economic capability and part responsibility. However it should a volunteer work.Companies which generate cigarettes have the economic capacity to give a hand to people who suffer from cancer from smoking. Because such companies make a significant profit from smoking people each year. Despite of the high taxes, those companies still earn a incredible profits. For example, it is proven that a New Zealand's company which manufacture cigarettes earn over hundrend millions dollars each year. If only one percent of those profits can be donated to a charity to support people who have cancer because of smoking, more people would be treated.Companies which generates cigarettes have part responsibility to the people who have cancer. As we known, The vast majority people who suffer from cancer because they smoke too much or they smoke the low quality of cigarettes. In stead pause just focus on the profits, there would be an decrease in the number of people who suffer from cancer, if those companies emphasize the quality and quantity they should make.However, people who suffer from cancer made their personal choices to smoke a lot. Companies who generate cigarettes do not need to entirely have the responsibility to the people who suffer from cancer from smoking.In conclusion, companies who generate cigarettes can contribute amount of money to help people who have cancer from smoking because of economic capability and part responsibility to cancer from smoking.	4	5	5	4	5	5
300457114	In recent years, the rate of cancer has increased because of more and more people are addicted to smoking, especially for adult and elder generation. It is often debated as to whether the companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking or not. This essay will argue that the drawbacks of this issue outweigh the benefits, due to the fact that a large of money will influence company’s economy and smoking people have main responsibility for developing cancer.The first reason to support this claim is that the most of people have cancer because they are addicted to smoking or smoking for a long time. For instance, some teenagers are willing to try smoking, as their curiosity are stronger than others and sometimes influenced by TV series, teenagers who want to imitate a hero's behaviors, including smoking. In addition, most business man are under the work pressure when they are in workplaces, smoking is a good way to help them released pressure. If they smoking more than the average number, the rate of rate for them will be increased. Therefore, companies which manufacture cigarettes are not necessary to pay compensation to smokers.Another argument for cigarettes companies shouldn't pay money for smokers is that the compensation will influence economy of cigarettes industry. The government levy high tax on cigarettes to prevent people are excessive smoking. Besides, if these cigarettes companies pay large amounts of money for people it will lead to increase prices of cigarettes, which bring economic pressure for smokers and companies.Some people argue that compensation from cigarettes companies will reduce finance pressures for the most of smokers who have cancer disease. However, it is not every smokers will have cancer, unless they are addicted or excessive to smoking. Furthermore, in order to prevent cancer from smoking, people need to keep healthy balance between life and smoking.In conclusion, it is not essential for companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer for smoking. Besides, the government and companies could produce promotional videos about importance relationship between smoking and cancer to smokers. Which is a effective way to encourage people are less smoking.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300457871	There are many views that smoking cigarettes causes a lot of damages to health such as cancer. This leads to the accusation of companies which produced cigarettes to be responsible for causing people to develop cancer by paying huge amounts of money as compensation. This essay will argue that it is not the responsibility of the cigarettes producers for causing cancer and paying large amount of money is not the last resort to combat cancer development. Rather it is the individual's moral and ethical choice and it's a deprivation of companies rights in making profits.one of the reasons for companies who produce cigarettes not to be liable for damages caused by smoking is that it is the individual's moral and ethical choice to either smoke or not. Every human beings have a profound awareness of what is right and wrong based on our ethical and moral judgement. Individuals should be accountable for their own actions. For instance, in every Cambridge cigarette package, there is a strong warning that reads; it is a government warning: smoking is dangerous to health. Individuals know that smoking is harmful to health. Yet, people take in smoking which resulted in inviting cancers. Therefore, companies should not be blamed for the damages it may incur on someone's health.The other reason why paying large sum of money as a form of compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking is that such practice deprives the rights of the companies to make profit. in other words it suppress the ability of the cigarette manufacturing companies to progress by making loss. Most companies are profit oriented and not service oriented. Paying of large amount as compensation is a company's liability cost. For instance, compensation, incidental cost, disaster or emergency cost and unplanned expenditures are are forms of company’s liability cost. Such are not assets that may turn into investments. Thus, paying of large amount as compensation only weakens the ability of a company to progress.Nevertheless, opponents of smoking argue that smoking cigarettes is a primary cause of cancer and manufacturers should be held accountable for the damages caused. Excessive smoking causes lung cancer and destroys the respiratory system which may eventually leads to chronic cancer. This accusation to some extend sound logical. However, there may be other factors that contribute to cancer such as, carbon monoxide produced by cars, methane gas is produced by intensive agricultural sectors and other harmful intoxicated gases released by transport and energy sectors. Those factors may be considered equal causes of cancer. Also, passive smoking may lead to develop cancer. As such, companies producing cigarettes should not be fully held liable for the damages that caused by other factors.In conclusion, ensuring cigarettes manufacturers to pay large amount of money as a form of compensation for developing cancer for smoking is not the right way. Such practices only depressing the company's ability to make profit. While it is the individual's choice.	5	5	5	5	5	5
300469240	Nowadays, cigarettes become a serious problem in the world. It obvious many people can buy every shop which make life harmful. Many companies can get profit by selling in our society. However, many people stat that there are an increasing the number of people die caused by cigarettes has more disadvantages than benefits because it make health problem, pay a lot of money for buy it and make environment problem.The 1st and most important to support my opinion that there are very high number of people die. Caused by toxic of accumulation of cigarettes. For example cancer and lung problem stop Moreover, some people pegnent get effect from smoking cigarettes then make baby help problem as well. Particularly, many money pay a lot for health careThe second reasons support my opinion that people pay money a lot to buy cigarettes in their daily life. Even many companies control the regulation from government. Companies or manufacture must do logo or picture on the top of cigarettes but people still buy cigarettes and pay a lot of moneyThe final reason support my opinion that environment problem because make a lot of pollution air in our society. many cigarettes make some people bad habit through garbage. For example road river.In conclusion, this problem required to government and producer’s responsibility extend also	2	3	3	3	3	2
300470958	Albeit the number of smoking people have reduced in the last decades, smoking still being a relevant public health issue. It's great the amount of people who develop cancer from smoking. Whilst activists against cigarettes defend that the manufacturers of cigarettes should pay money to people who develop smoking diseases, it's imperative to argue that smoking is a personal choice and some measures such as public policies to reduce smoking practice and high taxation are forms to struggle against cigarettes. It will be argued that another measures have combated the smoking habit and it is not necessary levy any compensation from cigarettes industry.Nowadays it is known for anyone that smoking can bring serious diseases and till being the death cause. Furthermore, advertisements, and campaigns on TV, magazines and newspapers disencourage people maintain the habit of smoking. Therefore, regarding this environment, it's clear that the option in smoking or non-smoking is a choice. People are aware of hour harmful is smoking, however, they did the personal choice.Moreover, public authorities have taken some actions to struggle against cigarettes. For instance, and a lot of cities around the world is prohibited smoking not only inside public and private places but also outside in the public areas. Additionally, governments promote public campaigns showing how smoking can bring drawbacks to human being.Finally, in a huge number of countries the taxation over the cigarettes cell is higher when compared with other consuming products. In Brazil, for example, the tax over cigarettes is around 40% as well as alcohol. This become the price of this product too much high and hence, it discourages people buy this drug.Opponents the smoking habit tend to blame the industry that people have died because of cigarette. Nevertheless, the cigarette industry is like any other and manufacturing a product because it is sold and has market. Thus, the companies don't owe nothing to their consumers.Summing up, smoking is a personal choice and to blame the cigarettes companies is not wright. In addition, governments and communities have tried awaring the population about that diseases linked with smoking habit. In the future it can change, but people have choose.	4	3	4	4	4	4
300471151	With the increasing of income, people are more likely to spend money on cigarettes. People who rely on cigarettes heavily smoke one pack of cigarettes every single day. Those companies which manufacture cigarettes gain a large amount of money from their products. Some people argue that government should limit cigarettes companies by higher tax. However, in my opinion, cigarettes manufacture companies should pay money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking.This first reason to support my opinion is that, many cancers are a result of smoking. There are many adverse impacts on smoking, especially on people's health. People who smoking for a long time are more likely to have cancer, for example, the cancer on lung is a common disease because of smoking. However, the cigarettes gain a large profit from their cigarettes. Therefore, cigarettes should pay money for those people who suffer from cancer, because of smoking.The research fund is the second reason to support my opion that cigarettes should pay money as compensation to people suffering from cancer. It is obvious that there is a huge experience on researching how to prohibit the cancer. Many researchers devote to research new medical technique to solve the problem of cancer. however, it need a large amount money for researching new medicines. If those companies which manufacture cigarettes are required to pay the bill for researching cancer, it would help the process of researching the cancer problems.In contrast, although smoking is a individual choose, some people argue that no one can be pushed to smoke. In fact, the negative effect is not just on the people who smoke cigarettes. According to research about family that had nearly one person smoking, the other families members could also be affected of smoking. This means that second-hand smoking has bad effects on people who are not smokers.In conclusion, cigarettes companies should pay money for people who develop cancer from smoking for its bad effects on health. There are all kinds of bad things in the cigarettes, and these bad materials can be absorbed by smoking and transferred to people. Those cigarettes companies gain lots of money, but bring healthy problems to people. Therefore, they should pay money as compensation for people who develop cancer from smoking.	3	4	4	4	4	4
300471155	Many studies have shown that smoking can develop cancer and many lung diseases. Such diseases have killed many people's life and over past decades. In fact, many people believe that it is significantly important for companies which manufacture cigarettes to pay some amounts of money to mitigate this issue. In this essay, I will discuss why they cigarettes companies should pay a compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. These reason include the high profits that cigarettes companies receive from people and over responsibility from governments.First of all, many cigarettes companies are making the high amount of profits for selling their products. In fact, these profit, I given by the pockets of cancer patients. Therefore, it is necessary for them to respond to this problem. For example, these profits may distribute to support health programs of lung cancer patients, and give it to communities to educate people to reduce the number of smokers.Secondly, the number of smokers have significantly increase in recents years. Instead of using money on transportation, or education, many governments have lost lots of money to help to save these cancer patients life. So, it is important for cigarettes companies to help governments to reduce this issue which caused by their business.On the other hand, some people may argue that it is a responsibility of smokers to take care themselves when they have health problems. In order to mitigate the problem efficient and effectively, it is significantly important for both cigarettes companies and governments to reduce and solve this issue.In conclusion, human resource is is important for developing countries, and many of them are dying from lung cancer which caused by smoking habits. Therefore, it is important for cigarettes companies to respond and reduce this problem.	3	4	4	4	4	4
300475608	nowadays, the number of people who smoke is showing an upward trend. People consider the cigarette could be relaxing and give them inspirations during the tiring work. Moreover, many teenagers start smoking because it looks cool. Unfortunately, the rate of smokers suffer cancer is also increasing sharply. Therefore, it is argued that companies which produce cigarettes should spend large amounts of money as compensation to the smokers who have cancer due to smoking. It is reasonable as the cigarettes are easily addictive and do severe damage to the body.The first reason that support that perspective is that cigarettes are literally addictive. The materials inside cigarettes are not only making people feel less stressful and metally refreshed, but also can be addictive that we find it is hard to quit smoking especially after a long period of doing so. According to many teenagers said, firstly they merely want to have in try as this seemed a cool behavior, whereas after a few months, they noticed that it is uneasy to live without cigarettes. Therefore, cigarettes are really addictive.Another notable reason is that the severe damage smoking can do to the human's body. When the cigarette starts burning, the toxic gas would go through the throat to the lungs. There were many testaments indicated that after a few weeks, the animal lungs or the cotton all turned black and were damaged. Hints, we can clearly conclude the shockly damage from smoking to our body.It is true that those companies which manufacture cigarettes are only product providers and it is not a compulsory for them to pay large amounts of funds, because the public choose to enjoy smoking anyway. However, the cigarette has distinct feature compared with the knife and gum, it is addictive substantially and this feature is actually encouraging people to keep smoking and gradually be addicted to the cigarette. Therefore, it would has a more positive impact if cigarette companies doing so.In conclusion, in terms of two aspects that the cigarette are easily to be addicted to and it literally does severe damage to humans body, it would be considered show a positive influence by cigarettes companies spending money as compensation to smokers who suffer cancer. Furthermore, it should not be that the company putting effort alone, the society need to encourage people to smoke less and the government can place some relevant policies to solve this problem.	4	4	5	4	4	5
300478180	Currently, people who smoke tend to decrease all over the world. There are a lot of risks because of smoking, so smokers should stop smoking. I will argue that it is good idea companies should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking because of costing a lot and bad for our health.Firstly, it costs a lot to buy cigarettes. In my country, cigarettes of price changed recently. These changed four hundreds yen to five hundreds yen. If we smoke a box everyday, where you might pay fifteen thousands yen per month. Per year, we might pay one hundred eighty thousands yen. It is too much for us.Secondly, smoking is bad for our health. Cigarettes are contained so many harmful things. It is very dangerous not only smokers but also non smokers. Also, smokers tend to show symptoms of serious ills, short temper, selfishness, losing perspective, eagerness of learning and so on. Especially, it is too terrible for women who have babies in their stomach babies might not be born activity.On the other hand, smokers love cigarettes like children love snacks. Smokers worked hard, then they smoke because it is relaxable to smoke for them. They might think people who smoke are very cool especially, men.In conclusion, it is good idea that companies should pay large amounts of money. I think the number of smokers are decreasing because high costs, getting serious ills, but there are many smokers in the world, so companies have to pay more money and then smokers need to stop smoking. I think healthy life is the best way to our life. Everyone have to live on comfortable.	2	3	3	3	3	3
300476975	I think that companies which manufacture cigarettes pays large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking is very good idea.Today, a lot of cities, shops are separating smoking area in the world. And the price of cigarettes gradually increased. Therefore, people who smoking are decreasing now.If companies which manufacture cigarettes pays a lot money, people who don't smoking get a lot benefit. Firstly, people who don't smoking will increase more and more.To pay a lot of money for people means becoming higher the price of cigarettes. I think it will also happen to decrease people who smoking.In addition, I believe that the number of people who have an cancer or a lot of disease by cigarettes will decrease.On the other hand, many people will disagree to this idea. Because only people who don't smoking have profits. And of course, the companies should pay a lot of money. I think the important point is reliability. Companies or people who smoking. Which has the reliability of cancer problem. I think both.In my conclusion, companies should pay a lot of money as compensation. But people who smoking also should pay money as compensation. And, everyone related to smoking should have reliability.	3	3	3	3	3	3
300478707	Generally, the number of people who have cancer from smoking is increasing and we see the people who use cigarettes somewhere. Some people describe that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from speaking, it seems good idea. There are the reasons below that supporting the idea.At first, it costs not only much money but also take a long time in order to treat cancer. Do you know how much costs to treat the cancer from smoking? Actually, it costs a large amounts of money. For instance, my uncle was heavy smoker and he took a lot of cigarettes in a day so he got cancer. He could get well by a treat but he lost a large amount of money. Because of the cigarettes from the company, he got the cancer. Therefore companies ought to pay the fee.Second, as you know, cigarettes have addiction so it is difficult to quite using it. In other word, the patients can't quite using it easily if they want to quite it. In the TV, we sometimes watch the documentary that people who worry about smoking addiction. They seem so annoyed about it and feel uncomfortable if they stop using it. The responsibility is in company without consumer who used cigarettes.Finally, they have cancer from smoking increase more, they can't live longer and it relates decreasing of population in the country. And contemporary society, the average die age tend to become short compared with previous the average of it. Nowadays, it is extremely big problem in all over the world, so in order to live longer, company stop this tendency by paying money that treat the cancer for people who have cancer.To sum up, the responsibility of having cancer is not an individuary person but in company that manufacture cigarettes that source of cancer. Therefore, companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amount of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking for consumer’s health.	4	4	4	4	3	4
300479617	Cigarette companies should pay a large sum of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. In my opinion this is a good idea. I have some reasons to support my ideas.The prime and principle reason is smoking is proved that provide lung cancer exactly. Not only men who smoke, but also people surrounding always get the second hand harmful chemicals from smoking. For example, a couple in real life who stay together husband smokes, but his wife doesn't smoke. His wife gets lung cancer from his smoking because she does not touch any smoke, she is a nurse and her ancestors don't have cancer history.The second reason to support my opinion is smoking destroy health and a quality of life. When people have lung cancer they suffer from physical and psychological effects. Someone could not work or pay attention in any activities. They always think about they will pass away soon, leave their families and their lovers.The final reason is lung cancer can spread to all organs quickly. After having a lung cancer diagnosis, almost patients will live around two months. During this time they have to admit in hospital. The government and the workplace lose money from hiring new person to compensate the missing staff. If there are not lung cancer patients from smoking, doctors and nurses will look after other patients.In contrast, cigarette companies don't use guns to force people smoking. Everybody smokes because he likes to smoke. He love the atmosphere of smoking. This should be his responsibility. Moreover smoking always start when people are teenagers because they follow the advertisement of smoking.In conclusion, cigarette companies should take responsibility of destroying health, well-being and income. In the future, government should launch a law prohibit smoking area, smoking advertisement and limited smoking salers.Some people believe that companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay a compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking. Some countries has a big contribution through selling cigarettes because this is a kind of addiction in the society. In addiction some part of the population believe that cigarettes are good to manage stress. However it is widely agree that cigarettes are are an addiction. This can be a risk of the young society.The first and main reason to support this claim is that cigarettes are an addiction in the society. Companies which produce cigarettes use differents kind of quimicals to create cigarettes. This quimicals has a big negative impact in health’s people. As an instance when a person become to smoke, some of then fell that have to smoke continuously because of the fact of their body’s need cigarettes. From this point of view the contribution of companies in the health is deteriorating it in instead of improving.The second reason to support this is that cigarettes can be a risking in young society. As an example in Colombia the pack of cigarettes is selling in $1.50 dollars. Young people do not need work to obtain $1.50. It can be retribute from their parents. Continuing with the example of Columbia some of the young become to smoke at 11 or 12 years old. Then they fell that needing taste other kind of addictive things as the cigarettes.Some people are widely agree with the participation of the cigarettes in life's people, and in the economy’s country. Thinking that through it, they can deliberate their stress and pression. Do not care to much about their health and the argument of this is that for a people’s die can occur in any moment and for any reason. Nonetheless cigarettes are the main reason of the huge problem the society is having with the illness of cancer.In conclusion it is widely agree that companies should contribute to the different people who are having or suffering because of the cancer a terrible and painful illness. Where in most of the case it is generating for the fact of the big negative impact that this is having in health.	4	4	3	4	3	4
300447416	In some countries around the world, the production of cigarettes is increasing from day to day due to the high demand of men even women including young and old people. However, the consequense of smoking cigarettes also has killed thousands of people every year. Therefore, doctors work to fight against the cancer which is caused by smoking through inventing medicine to combat the illness. Thus, the cigarettes company should pay the health experts who found the medicine as compensation. This SA will argue that cigarettes company has to compensate the cancer developer because the invention of the medicine takes much time and it is as a way to mitigate cigarettes production.First of all, the invention of cancer medicine takes a long period of time to create it. It is evident that the finding of medicine for certain disease needs a thorough experiment. It needs patience and high knowledge and technological tools. Thus, it is imperative that the cigarettes factory compensate the cancer medicine developer.The other important idea that the cigarettes company should pay a large amount of money to the cancer medicine inventor is that it can help reduce cigarettes production. This is one of the ways to reduce the number of patients who suffer from the cancer sticks. when the company pay a large amount of Money as compensation then the cigarettes production might be reduced.It is true that cigarettes company can contribute to the country’s economy through paying tax. Some countries may generate a large amount of income from cigarettes tax. However, the revenue gained from the cigarettes is too little if compared with its causes which kills thousand of people every year. Therefore, the cigarettes company may be obliged to recompensate the cancer medicine developer who have contribute to cure a lot of people who suffered from cancer.In conclusion, although many countries in the world migh yield a lot of money from cigarettes company, the cigarettes has destroyed many people’s lives. Therefore, it is crucial for the cigarettes factory to recompensate the cancer developers as they have saved numerous human kinds who become victims of the cigarettes.	4	4	5	5	5	4
300448668	Nowadays, smoking is become but to some people around the world. Companies who made and sell cigarettes gained lots of money from it. it is apparent that cigarettes causes some critical diseases such as cancer so stop this issue has been widespread and this likely to blame the company which manufacture cigarettes. Some people and companies argue that it is not their responsibility and it is a loss for their business If they pay large amount of money as compensation people who suffer from cancer. However, it will be argued here that companies which produce or manufacture cigarettes should pay vast amount of money as compensation and aid to people who suffur from cancer as in fact they motivated people by they product and cause savere and critical disease and also people spend lots of money buying their product.First point to support that company with manufacture series or produced cigarettes should pay large amount as compensation to people because they motivate people and attributed to the suffer also the people from cancer. Companies knows that cigarette causes cancer but they still motivate and supply cigarette and for global market. Some people buy it because how attractive of cigarettes and Hao companies advertise it. Therefore, companies which manufacture the cigarettes should aids and pay huge amount of money for people who suffered from cancer.Another point to Support that companies gain more money from people as a result of their business gain profit. The manufacturer end companies which produced and supply cigarettes should contributes lots of money for people who suffer cancer. It is apparent that these people suffered from cancer are the people that spend lots of money buy cigarettes. Hints, companies that supply and make cigarettes should donate huge amount of money as compensation to those people. Their profit is from these people that suffered from cancer, therefore, they should donate huge money for these people that got cancer from smoking.Some people and companies may argue that this is not their responsibility, buy cigarettes for commercial reason that free of choice for the people. It is people choice to buy their product or not they may argue it is also a loss for their business if they take huge money is compensation for cancer people however, it is clearly that this is not a loss for those companies that made cigarettes. These companies have more profit and gain lots of money from their product. They even induce people to choose cigarettes as a stress free and solution for their problem is to smoke. Consequently, people tend to suffer from cancer so it is the companies which manufacture cigarettes responsibility to pay huge money as compensation.In conclusion, companies which produce product that causes severe disease such as cancer should donate and contribute huge amount of money as compensation to people who suffered. These people are their customers that spend more money on their product, not only that but the companies motivated them to addict to smoking. Therefore, it is not a loss for those companies for the people not only money but their life. So companies should pay huge amount of money as compensation.	4	4	5	4	4	4
300422495	Cigarettes become very common in our life. With the social development cigarette become main industry for some companies. Nowadays some companies make many cigarettes with cheap price. Most people easy to buy cigarettes. This situation brings some issues full of humans life like, some people develop cancer from smoking. Therefore some people think companies which industry cigarettes should pay mini for people who have cancer from smoking but I consider that companies shouldn't pay large amounts of money as compensation to people, because people develop cancer with cigarettes that isn't responsibility for companies and every adult could control themselve.Firstly people cancer with cigarettes that isn't responsible for companies. As a company that only make cigarettes and sell it. The company don't told people, which is nessery for people life. When people have big stress they will smoking. Therefore most time people smoking by themselve. for cigarettes company that neve tall people cigarettes, which have benefits for people's health. Therefore cigarettes shouldn't pay amounts of money is compensation to people.Secondly, every adult should have controlling ability. In some countries like New Zealand, only adult could buy cigarettes. Why adults different with children because most adults have controlling abilities. When that companies sell their cigarettes, every cigarettes has a sentence or bad pictures on the box. Therefore when the adults by a series, they aware the sentence meaning, so they should to control themselve without smoking. When a person become a adults they have controlling ability already. There when they got cancer, they to solve disease by themselve.Finally some believe that if many people develop cancer, if the company doesn't sell cigarettes then that the people can't a place to buy a cigarettes. In this way will less people develop cancer. Howeve, when people want to smoking, they will have many methods to get a cigarettes after that people develop cancer so stop it isn't responsibility to a company, so why a company need to pay compensation to people with smoking? Most cigarettes companies tall people smoking is very bad people's health.In conclusion, companies shouldn't pay money for people who develop cancer from smoking companies only make cigarettes keep health is compusry and responsibility for a person.	4	3	3	3	3	3
300446945	Most of people start smoking in recent years. Some people think cigarettes can make them relaxed and they would like to buy them. Others think cigarettes are unhealthy and should not be sold so companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay large amounts of money to people who develop cancer from smoking. In my opinion, companies which manufacture cigarettes should not pay a huge number of cigaretts to people who develop cancer from smoking because buying cigarettes is individual action and companies only produce the cigaretts that society need.The first reason that companies should not pay large amounts of money as compensation to people is smoking is individual action and habit. All the countries have law that only allow adults buy cigarettes and limit the ages of people who can buy cigaretts. That means people can think of the disadvantages and results of smoking as adults and they can be responsible for their health. Buying cigarettes is individual actions and habits so companies should not be responsible for the adults who buy cigarettes, smoking and then develop cancer from smoking. Therefore companies should not pay money to them.The second reason is that companies should not pay for people who have cancer from smoking his companies only produced cigarettes that society need. In addition, manufacturing in selling cigarettes is not illegal and most of the countries do not have advertisements on TV and other public place. That means companies don't avoid people to buy the cigarettes as well as do not make them interested and cigarettes. Therefore, people developing cancer from smoking is not companies' responce so that paying to people is also unbalance to companies.In conclusion, companies which manufacture cigarettes should not pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking because buying cigarettes and smoking is all individual actions and companies only make in order to society need. In addition, it is not companies’ compensation.	3	4	3	4	4	4
300445396	Today, there is an increasing number of people who are suffering from lung cancer due to the tobacco consumed. Therefore, somebody claim that the tobacco companies should take the responsibility and invest in the compensation for developing cancer. In my opinion, the tobacco companies should not take charge of that, because smoking is personal activity and the cigarette company might increase the price of tobacco to earn the money back.Firstly, smoking is personal activity. In other words, smokers should take charge of their health and give up to smoke. That means if people do not want to suffer from the cancer, they would chose to use electronic cigarettes even give up smoking. In addition, if the rate of cancer caused by the tobacco decline, more people might not fear to the health problems and start smoking in an young age. So, but best solution of reducing the rate of cancer is persuade people to give up tobacco. On the other hand, some people claim that the cigarette companies should invest in developing cancer because the companies are wealthy. We cannot deny the fact but the tobacco companies are wealthy and have the ability to develop cancer. However, the expendeture of cancer study might make no sense to them, thus they are not willing to do that. If they are asked to invest in the cancer study, they might increase the price of cigarettes. In other words, the investors are the smokers instead of the cigarette companies.In conclusion, smokers should take charge of their health and give up cigarettes, which is the best strategy to keep away from the lung cancer.	3	4	4	4	4	4
300437784	There is a wide belief that smoking is harmful for residents body conditions. Pomotion of non- smoking is an ongoing process. Some citizens argue that the cigarette companies should pay a large amount of money due to caused people get cancer. From my perspective, it is a benefit idea for both people’s health and environmental protection.The first and foremost reason to support my opinion is that Ken limited cigarette companies’ productive. As a result, it could be increasing difficuilties for smokers to buy cigarettes to smok. Thus, it is a effective way for them to stop smoking. According to China Daily reported that a large majority of smokers think that it is effortless for them to buy cigarettes. So when the companies which manufacture cigarettes limited to produce cigarettes due to concern if people develop cancer from smoking, they should pay large amounts of money for them. For companies, it is not suitable for it is running. Therefore, consider about a long-term profit. It is a correct method to limited cigarettes’ produce. Limited cigarette companies’ productive is benefit for company themselves in citizens’ body conditions.Another reason for supporting my reason is that when companies should pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who get cancer from smoking , at that time, many newspapers may report that. Thus, it is a warning for other smokers, smoking is harmful. With an increasing number of smokers reliease smoking have some drawbacks, consequently, it may reduce or stop to smok. When people smoking, it may emit the smok that may lead to air pollution. Breakingnews in NZ reported that polluted air is the fourth highest cause of global death. Therefore, for all the residents health, protecting our environment is everyone's responsability.Having said that, there still exist drawback when company restrict on cigarettes produce. It may increase the number of people lose their job, because the company does not need too many workers work for them. Thus, those workers could not support their family due to they lose their job. It is true that it may bring pressure for some families. However, compared with environmental protection and people’s health, it is not a serious issue. After all, we only have an earth for living.To conclude, when the company concern their long-term development, they may limited their production and it is a correct way four protect our environment and people's health. In the future, with society developing, people may have higher awareness of health.	3	4	4	4	3	4
300446941	Smoking is becoming the most serious problem all over the world. Lots of people addict in smoking and dead because of smoking. Should factories which produce cigarettes pay more money for people as compensation is argued by governments’ staff. This essay will argue that these factories should pay money for people who develop cancer. There are two reasons to support that.Firstly, factories have responsibilities to take care of patients who were developed cancer. Because people buy cigarettes and smoke, companies should be responsble to their own products. They should pay more attention on people who have some physical problems. Smokers also can use these money to threat their illness. Factories make profit from smoker, they also should be responable to help smokers, even that will increase budget of whole factories working.Secondly, if companies pay these money, it is good for companies’ reputation and can make brand of these companies more and more famous . For example, smokers will not consider when they go to shopping to buy cigarette. Because, the company who produced the cigarette has good reputation. People trust it. People know it. It is not a company which only earned money from smokers, it also care about smokers. Legitimecy, society and profit are drivers make company have to do that. Company have to follow consumers’ demand and wishes.Some people think if companies pay these money for smokers, companies have no profit to get, they were reduced cost and qualities of cigarette. At least, smokers are the payers of this situation. It is true, that will reduce budget, but it makes companies become more responable and sustainable. This way will attract more people to buy cigarette, even the price is little higher than others. So, it is benefits for companies, not only benefits for their own reputation, but also good for smokers. They can enjoy high qualities of cigarette and get low rate of cancer.It Is difficult for people stop smoking, while it is easy for cigarette factories pay some money as compensation from their huge amounts of profit. With the development of high technology and company’s help, less people will develop cancer from smoking. And smoking will not be a serious problem in the future. People can enjoy themselves by anyway.	4	4	4	4	4	4
300446931	Since humanity entered the 21st centry, health issue has already became a big question for everybody. Currently, there is a widespread concern over the issue is that tobaccos’ companies needs spend large amount of money to help people deal with cancer from smoking. This essay will argue that tobaccos’ companies needn't pay large amounts of money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking, Because cigarettes is consumers own choice and those companies has already helped lots of economic industrys develop.First of all, tobacco is consumers own opition. As we all know, cigarettes companies fundamental function is a company, which need earn the money. In economic theory, consum behavior will impact product. For example, nowadays a vast majority of tobacco companies will not have advertisement and also have some warning on it’s products, but still lost of consumer willing to spend a large of money on this and have cancer finally. In some, consumers behavior, especially for bad behavior, needn’t let companies pay for it.For the second view, a large number of cigarettes companies has already spent money on local area’s economic development. Ta Shan which is a popular cigarettes bround amoung Chinese consumer because of it’s approach prices. This companies localed in a very poor area in South west of China spite of the fact that it is a tobacco company. It still spend a large amount of money on local areas economic and education, and then helped that areas people have a happiness lifestyle. In the world, there still have lots of companies who like Ta Shan and we can't let them pay more, because they have already did it.On the contrary, some people think tobacco is the elements evil, if companies will not product it. Why some people will have carncers? It is currecy that cigarettes is a harmful product and lots of people don't like it, but like a saying ‘lives thing have their own theory’ most of consumer willing put money on it and it can help govenment get more tax. In many contries tobacco have a heavy tax and companies and consumers need pay some extar money on it, and so on, they needn't pay others like help cancer illness.In conclusion, this essay has argued that tobaccos’ companies needn't pay extra money as compensation to people who develop cancer from smoking because it's consumers own choice and tobacco’s companies has already did some positive things. In addition, if tobacco companies need be more sustainable, must do some thing and consumer need do it too.	4	3	4	4	3	4
300444606	Currently, smoking problem has become one of the most pressing issue on the international agenda. Compared with the past, a increase number of people have cancer because of smoking. It is generally accepted that companiese which produce cigaretts should pay certainly money for the health care of those smokers who buy their products. This method can not only reduce the economic burden of government, but also pay responsibilities for their consumers.First and foremost, tobacoo compaines can help government to solve a part of economic burden of public medical resources. Smokers have consumed a significant number of money to gain the treatment for their diseases, in particular the cancer. It has increased the economic burden of government, they have to spend a large amount of money to support the public medical resources. This means that government will reduce the investment for other social problems, such as education and transportation. Therefore, fat companies which manufacture cigarettes should pay a considerable money is compensation to those tobacoo consumers. It is a effective way to solve the deficit problem of government.Another reason is that cigarettes can be limited by compensation fees that companies must to pay. The cigarettes can make the companies to profit from sale and export, yet it will damage environment and the health of people. Some of countries want to limit the tobacoo industry through taxing, but it doesn't a effective method. If those companies have to pay money for their consumers health conditions, they will be limited to sale the cigarettes. This way is not only solve the limit of cigarettes saling problem, but also make that compaines have responsibilities for their consumers.Some people argue that the companies don't have to pay extra money for cancer patients due to smoking, they should responcible themselves. It is true that not every smoker will have cancer or other health problem. However, the companies sale a large amount of cigarettes have certainly impact on this problem. Therefore, they should pay the responsibilities to help government solve this problem, and protect their consumers health.In conclusion, although people should responsible for themselve health problem, that tobacco companies also should pay money for cancer patients, because they should pay responsibilities.	4	3	4	4	3	4
300473269	What is the trend of current world? Actually, to develop technology has become a priority for almost all countries. It was but hundred years ago, when the first computer wasn't painted, people's life was altered. In twenty first century, mobile phones with Internet came to our life. However, the discussion on whether smartphones are conductive to teenagers is a hot issue. Some people think phones should be given to people aged 8 to 12 because it is useful for communicating with families. While I believe that smart phones should be banned for young children who are 8 to 12 because of the disadvantages of social media and the lack of self-control.It is undeniable that cell phones could be the distraction for children's study. It's probably because young children do not have the ability to concentrate on what they are able to do. Instead, they are curious of cell phones with additional functions such as chatting software or Internet. In this way, their academic results may be affected. What is more, children are too young to manage their time well. For example, some of them are more likely to use their phones during the class, that will puzzled the teachers as well. Thus, the young age caused children to use phones incorrectly.Another point is that social media plays a major role in smart phones. This could affect children to access some trash information. For instance, there are many porns or violent videos attached in advertisements. Children during that age are prone to be attracted by those information, so that their mental health would not be protected. Moreover, they may tend to do some harmful things for society if they watched the anti-behavior related videos. For example, students are more likely to imitate the drunks to destroy the street. Therefore, mobiles phone could be harmful for those young people.Although some people may say phones could build connection between parents and children. In this way, their safety could be ensured somehow. However, to acquire the information about children's, there are many alternative ways, such as calling teachers, asking headmasters or consulting their classmates. Compared with the disadvantages of mobile phones, banning phones are possibly benefit for young children's health.In conclusion, the conductive as it is to communication, their shortage of phones other way the benefits for those aged 8 to 12. Maybe provide phones when they are older could be better for both children and family.	3	3	3	3	3	3
300476977	Recently, technology enables people to live conveniently and get a variety of benefits. Accordingly, more young people tend to use mobile phones compared to previous years. I strongly disagree this argument that the use of mobile phones for children between 8 and 12 years old because it is possible that the lack of communicate skill and face to face and it might lead to bullying.The first reason I want to be opposite position of the argument is that young people have a possibility to lose communicate with other people directly. For example, if young people usually use mobile phones such as iPhone and Android as a communication tool, they are able to contact to other people indirectly. It can indicate that young people might prefer online communication to direct communication. And they cannot communicate with other people in face to face very well.in addition, the use of mobile phones in young age (8 to 12 year old) can lead to bullying. In fact, bullying is one of the most serious issues in school. Moreover, one of the causes of this problem is mobile phones. Most of young people don't know how to use mobile phones well. And they tend to use in wrong way as bullying. It has a bad impact on children's growth and might result in suicide.however, some may agree that the use of mobile phones for 8 to 12 aged children, claiming that it is an effective and convenient way to communicate with other people. In fact mobile phones have a plenty of benefits. But young people cannot use mobile phones very well because their brain is not growing enough. That is why disadvantage of the use of mobile phones outweighs the advantages.In conclusion, I prefer that young people should	3	3	4	4	4	4
300479609	With the development of information technology, people's life has been changed quickly. For the new generations, mobile phone has because done most frequently communication tools with their family and friends. However, some people argue that the use of mobile phones for 8-12 year old children may leads to some negative effects. Overall it is unreasonable.The first significant reason to support the use of mobile phone for teens is that this is an inevitable revolution for human being’s society. Furthermore, there many advantages in this case. For instance, teens could profit cell phone's convenience in order to improve their study performance. Especially for language learner, need dictionary may replace the traditional paper dictionary totally. Only few seconds, people will find out the word directly by search engine. By contrast, the traditional dictionary takes more time on searching process.Another reason to agree young people to maintain their mobile phones is that for the period age of 8-12 year old, security is one of the most concern for their parents. Their cell phones can give the guarantee of safe if the teens involved any incidents. Moreover, most of cell phones has GPS system nowadays. In the frequent earthquake areas, it is easier to locate people who need helps.Certainly, despite mobile phone brings many benefits for people, the negative effects still exist. For example, many children and teens overuse mobile technology and be toxided by cell phone. When they leave their phones, it occurs some negative effects such as anxiety or depress. additionally, some children stay at night in order to play cell phone games and affect their quality of sleep. Whereas, if people balance the advantages and disadvantages of mobile phone uses. It is easy to find out that the advantages of mobile phone uses outweigh the disadvantages because the above problems can be controlled with their growth.In conclusion, the development of technology can not be resisted. It might be a cliche that the technology development will modify people's life, particularly for the future generations. However, people ought to aware that they should intend to accept the new circumstances but not concentrate on their nice flash-back memories.	4	4	4	3	4	4
